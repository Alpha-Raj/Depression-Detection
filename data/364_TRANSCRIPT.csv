227.317	227.807	Participant	well
228.037	229.307	Participant	more of some maybe some of the
229.737	232.732	Participant	things i don't like about l_a or say california in general
233.032	234.582	Participant	say like the high tax rate
235.152	239.912	Participant	which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now
240.167	243.157	Participant	which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations
243.317	244.787	Participant	i'm a small business owner
245.327	256.142	Participant	so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated
256.76	259.99	Participant	and uh that's a big problem here in uh
260.25	262.16	Participant	uh california
262.55	263.39	Ellie	that_sucks (that sucks)
263.485	267.21	Participant	it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh
267.96	269.06	Participant	also uh
270.315	276.67	Participant	you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't
277.127	280.937	Participant	see that but it's a big tax on the social service system
281.337	283.107	Participant	and that's what makes our taxes
283.507	287.477	Participant	uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
288.065	288.535	Ellie	mm (mm)
288.627	289.447	Participant	so that's
290.092	300.099	Participant	you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
300.925	301.435	Ellie	mhm (mhm)
302.213	308.394	Ellie	travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot)

326.269	327.299	Participant	uh
328.919	331.099	Participant	i didn't really understand uh your question
332.634	337.949	Participant	when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and
339.144	341.874	Participant	i've been all through europe eastern europe

343.184	344.434	Participant	south america
344.914	346.084	Participant	north africa
346.644	354.344	Participant	um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf
354.564	357.004	Participant	'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up
357.859	361.439	Participant	and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga
361.704	364.174	Participant	and work out and uh
364.434	366.294	Participant	i try to eat healthy and uh
366.954	369.224	Participant	that's a big part of my life
369.869	371.549	Ellie	travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
371.744	372.214	Participant	oh
372.574	373.274	Participant	sure
373.499	383.219	Participant	um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span
383.501	391.191	Participant	but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times
391.511	395.571	Participant	we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local
395.856	397.896	Participant	and rented a small flat and
398.661	401.151	Participant	cooked and did our own shopping but really
401.566	404.896	Participant	having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days
405.296	410.561	Participant	it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city
410.861	414.461	Participant	and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french
414.826	419.711	Participant	which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger
419.956	422.446	Participant	my mother insisted that all of us kids
422.656	427.886	Participant	take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh
428.716	433.256	Participant	all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
433.834	434.564	Ellie	nice (nice)
434.126	439.326	Participant	so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french
439.486	440.486	Participant	with the french
440.721	446.106	Participant	you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
446.343	447.143	Ellie	wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
447.666	449.801	Participant	<laughter> so that was a
449.679	450.819	Ellie	study (what did you study at school)
451.421	452.311	Participant	uh
452.851	454.951	Participant	i have a few different degrees
455.456	459.781	Participant	so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate
461.131	462.541	Participant	and uh
462.911	463.961	Participant	that was fun
464.331	465.781	Participant	and i also have a masters
466.101	468.061	Participant	uh degree in economics
468.886	471.266	Participant	and i have a degree in crisis management
472.581	473.021	Participant	so
473.059	474.489	Ellie	change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
475.061	476.761	Participant	uh i found them um
477.276	478.386	Participant	interesting
478.796	479.996	Participant	and uh
480.901	482.601	Participant	it was something that i wanted to do
482.736	486.921	Participant	where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports
487.301	491.766	Participant	and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland
492.231	494.271	Participant	and i originally wanted to be a doctor but
494.716	496.416	Participant	once you start going to school
496.641	498.731	Participant	for a little bit you change your mind
499.101	500.381	Participant	etcetera so
500.335	500.845	Ellie	mhm (mhm)
502.673	503.933	Ellie	still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
504.686	508.986	Participant	um i'm actually in the wholesale business now
509.486	512.751	Participant	for wholesale distributors of furniture products
513.566	517.276	Participant	and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago
517.56	522.895	Participant	well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business
523.15	524.57	Participant	and it's
525.095	527.825	Participant	pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it
528.175	530.635	Participant	but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
531.429	532.629	Ellie	dream_job (what's your dream job)
533.83	534.47	Participant	hm
534.875	542.18	Participant	actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home
542.705	544.125	Participant	and uh
545.14	545.98	Participant	uh
546.665	551.315	Participant	i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter
551.99	553.2	Participant	and uh
552.325	553.005	Ellie	aw (aw)
553.955	557.735	Participant	you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked
558.32	566.85	Participant	but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids
567.25	575.34	Participant	you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life
575.54	576.04	Participant	so
576.082	576.552	Ellie	yeah3 (yeah)
576.5	579.23	Participant	probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
582.084	586.503	Ellie	shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
585.72	591.42	Participant	uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers
591.84	594.65	Participant	but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable
595.25	597.68	Participant	i think i'm more of an extrovert
598.28	601.29	Participant	whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted
601.48	612.68	Participant	but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation
613.84	616.61	Participant	and be more um
617.29	618.32	Participant	introverted
618.89	627.025	Participant	i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
628.051	628.511	Ellie	okay_confirm (okay)
631.516	643.294	Ellie	relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
643.152	646.072	Participant	oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh
646.587	649.412	Participant	one of my i have uh several computers at home
649.972	653.222	Participant	and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well
653.752	667.922	Participant	i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach
668.457	673.082	Participant	you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
674.012	677.737	Participant	it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years
678.302	679.182	Participant	i had
679.707	680.477	Participant	it uh
681.217	684.827	Participant	i usually find exercise helps me relax the best
685.107	689.287	Participant	or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>
690.952	695.895	Participant	but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
696.526	697.426	Ellie	thats_great (that's great)
698.215	699.945	Participant	yes that was uh
700.235	701.165	Participant	that was it but
701.515	706.535	Participant	that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills
706.7	709.54	Participant	i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years
710.01	711.8	Participant	i think i've gotten better
712.53	713.905	Participant	uh at the
712.868	713.398	Ellie	yeah2 (yeah)
714.74	717.28	Participant	i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature
717.795	720.615	Participant	as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and
721.165	722.295	Participant	be a little more
722.815	724.925	Participant	how do you had had the skills earlier
727.187	729.247	Ellie	control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
729.965	734.38	Participant	i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged
734.99	736.06	Participant	um
736.45	737.41	Participant	you know i
738.235	742.355	Participant	i am more likely to think before i speak now
742.58	746.44	Participant	whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought
747.115	749.245	Participant	so i might've said more things that i
750.105	753.775	Participant	in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or
754.3	755.75	Participant	a work situation
756.48	757.45	Participant	um
757.75	765.025	Participant	but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it
765.31	769.72	Participant	i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
769.903	770.373	Ellie	uh_huh (uh huh)
771.34	775.42	Participant	so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
776.754	779.804	Ellie	last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
779.83	780.85	Participant	oh wow
781.275	786.595	Participant	you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional
787.64	789.53	Participant	argument um
790.26	791.33	Participant	probably
792.39	793.28	Participant	um
793.67	798.62	Participant	my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter
799.12	801.55	Participant	and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just
801.7	806.885	Participant	basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting
807.71	809.31	Participant	and uh just
810.155	813.415	Participant	uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused
813.84	817.03	Participant	us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument
817.44	821.755	Participant	but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree
822.28	823.15	Participant	butt heads
823.37	823.89	Participant	so
824.49	826.03	Ellie	describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
827.705	829.785	Participant	i felt like i was talking to a wall
830.26	833.33	Participant	and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've
833.99	840.06	Participant	learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should
840.815	844.065	Participant	usually have but you're not really thinking of that because
844.44	845.74	Participant	sometimes when we're younger we're
846.285	850.445	Participant	looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me
850.885	852.085	Participant	but you know
852.48	854.37	Participant	i'm pretty easy going and i have
854.92	855.55	Participant	different
855.91	858.13	Participant	ideas on raising children how she did
858.375	859.455	Participant	and that was more
859.79	867.445	Participant	not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really
868.152	871.182	Participant	discussed those things but it was really just fundamental
871.512	874.967	Participant	reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match
871.773	872.213	Ellie	yeah_downer (yeah)
875.427	877.227	Participant	whereas other things looked good
877.902	879.942	Participant	you know on paper to both of us
881.478	881.988	Ellie	mhm (mhm)
883.787	887.565	Ellie	situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
888.647	889.237	Participant	hm
895.467	899.482	Participant	there's one recently my father passed away uh recently
899.931	900.671	Ellie	im_sorry (i'm sorry)
900.897	901.687	Participant	thank you
901.997	903.437	Participant	and
904.582	911.062	Participant	really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days
911.447	915.677	Participant	and i really only invited very very close friends and family members
916.087	920.627	Participant	i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of
921.312	924.827	Participant	not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a
925.897	929.547	Participant	i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact
929.887	934.287	Participant	that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known
934.607	940.092	Participant	about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but
940.509	942.749	Participant	now as time's passed i wish i'd invited
943.244	947.154	Participant	more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends
947.474	952.804	Participant	you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just
953.344	958.259	Participant	and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because
958.634	964.909	Participant	i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but
965.246	968.411	Participant	i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little
969.286	975.241	Participant	they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that
975.708	979.568	Participant	you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less
980.203	984.648	Participant	doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really
984.943	991.165	Participant	mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so
991.977	992.417	Ellie	isee_downer (i see)
994.06	996.764	Ellie	family_relationship (tell me about your relationship with your family)
997.615	1000.88	Participant	um well both my parents are recently
1003.285	1005.785	Participant	uh deceased in the last couple of years
