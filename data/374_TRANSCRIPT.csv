1001.27	1007.87	Participant	the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project
1008.19	1018.81	Participant	so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah
1019.2	1022.72	Participant	and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer
1023.78	1028.48	Participant	and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how
1029.2	1029.73	Participant	he
1030.35	1037.96	Participant	i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know
1038.35	1039.97	Participant	even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore
1040.38	1045.43	Participant	he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic
1045.96	1050.11	Participant	decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me
1051.15	1057.28	Participant	but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic
1058.3	1059.67	Participant	yada yada so
1060.29	1064.02	Participant	to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me
1064.45	1070.8	Participant	um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point
1071.23	1073.62	Participant	he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me
1073.98	1077.17	Participant	and later on like a couple of months down the road
1077.51	1081.34	Participant	i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still
1082.15	1088.45	Participant	ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um

1103.92	1110.55	Participant	it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like
1111.98	1122.51	Participant	that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like
1123.25	1124.32	Participant	in a way that's like
1124.73	1130.89	Participant	that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like
