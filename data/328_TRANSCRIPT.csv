250.67	263.11	Participant	that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so
263.74	264.87	Participant	it gets very uh 
265.4	265.74	Participant	um
266.53	274.66	Participant	annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt
275.3	283.71	Participant	it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so

295.76	305.19	Participant	but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it
306.06	308.22	Participant	you as a parent you're happy they got it 
309.28	309.87	Ellie	that's good
