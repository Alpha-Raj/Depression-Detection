965.55	965.78	Participant	xxx
967.14	967.62	Participant	i don't know

972.59	972.98	Participant	so
974.12	975.05	Participant	probably those things
975.942	976.402	Ellie	okay_confirm (okay)
977.508	982.827	Ellie	feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
981.7	982.03	Participant	mm
984.66	985.11	Participant	hmm
992.28	995.09	Participant	so at the last organization i used to work at
995.875	998.155	Participant	i had a boss and she was
998.74	1000.86	Participant	i don't feel like she was um
1003.36	1007.55	Participant	i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh
1008.605	1010.655	Participant	used to push my buttons or so i thought
1011.48	1013.24	Participant	and so um
1015.11	1021.26	Participant	one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer
1021.82	1025.09	Participant	um and he was upset about something and
1025.55	1032.61	Participant	it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was
1033.14	1033.56	Participant	um
1034.53	1038.99	Participant	but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i
1039.5	1042.6	Participant	have very strong opinions about how you handle
1043.33	1046.01	Participant	challenges with people <peo> with staff members
1046.108	1046.638	Ellie	yeah2 (yeah)
1046.57	1050.45	Participant	and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought
1050.92	1054.88	Participant	um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel
1055.74	1059.71	Participant	um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it
1060.24	1061.36	Participant	and um
1062.45	1063.39	Participant	i did you know
1063.79	1065.32	Participant	i tried to be very calm and
1066.16	1069.37	Participant	said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but
1070.38	1075.1	Participant	uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there
1075.59	1082.45	Participant	to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me
1082.83	1084.51	Participant	or after we had that interaction so
1082.985	1083.425	Ellie	yeah_downer (yeah)
1085.391	1085.831	Ellie	isee_downer (i see)
1087.786	1090.736	Ellie	advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
1091.96	1093.38	Participant	<laughter>
1094.48	1098	Participant	so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this
1098.79	1102.45	Participant	thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had
1103.08	1104.14	Participant	read it back then
1104.85	1105.59	Participant	which is
1106.11	1109.09	Participant	um when you think about buying something instead of thinking
1109.79	1110.77	Participant	uh oh
1111.37	1115.06	Participant	here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it
1115.89	1119.35	Participant	it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that
1119.75	1125.49	Participant	because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it
1126.12	1126.4	Participant	you know
1126.93	1130.83	Participant	intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so
1131.24	1137.77	Participant	you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh
1138.64	1140.7	Participant	been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
1141.309	1142.039	Ellie	hmmB (hmm)
1145.01	1147.31	Ellie	Ellie17Dec2012_08 (what are you most proud of in your life)

1151.22	1156.65	Participant	scrubbed_entry
1157.14	1161.93	Participant	um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them
1162.545	1172.705	Participant	and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them
1173.27	1173.6	Participant	so
1176.043	1176.503	Ellie	okay_confirm (okay)
1178.085	1181.335	Ellie	Ellie17Dec2012_10 (tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed)
