313.63	315.84	Participant	and i like to travel more um
317.15	323.04	Participant	i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel
324.42	325.9	Ellie	what do you enjoy about traveling
327.27	336.58	Participant	seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change 
337.33	342.97	Participant	i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of 
344.05	347.58	Participant	where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that
348.85	349.16	Ellie	uh huh
349.08	351.64	Participant	but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>
352.34	353.03	Ellie	<laughter>
353.08	353.87	Participant	<laughter> <clears throat>
354.46	356.03	Ellie	i'd love to hear about one of your trips
357.94	358.91	Participant	um
359.77	360.22	Participant	let's see
361.19	369.65	Participant	xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line
371.18	374.2	Participant	um my cousin and i would take what we call
375.12	383.43	Participant	exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just  
384.38	388.19	Participant	sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off
388.81	395.14	Participant	so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight
395.99	398.21	Participant	just small short trips that
399.36	403.31	Participant	aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how
403.95	412.37	Participant	um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas 
411.71	412.01	Ellie	uh huh
413.16	414.65	Participant	so close to home but not
415.95	424.35	Participant	but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that
425.14	434.98	Participant	kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway
435.48	435.86	Ellie	yeah
435.9	438.6	Participant	so i i like i like doing that
436.23	437.22	Ellie	i see what you mean
439.84	440.11	Ellie	cool
440.91	442.46	Ellie	when was the last time that happened
443.94	449.91	Participant	the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that

450.64	455.45	Participant	we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am
456.33	463.3	Participant	and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live
463.95	467.21	Participant	so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas
467.93	474.1	Participant	and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda
474.9	477.94	Participant	i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there
478.64	479.7	Participant	and we came back and was
480.47	480.89	Participant	you know
481.56	485.59	Participant	an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so
485.37	485.75	Ellie	wow
487.95	489.25	Participant	it was kind of an interesting
488.57	490.68	Ellie	what are some things that make you really mad
492.88	503.14	Participant	uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back  
504.25	504.9	Participant	and
506.14	506.85	Participant	i actually
508.24	509.71	Participant	like to see people who are
511.41	517.75	Participant	strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate
518.36	518.7	Ellie	yeah
518.6	519.23	Participant	or what have you
520.58	524.79	Participant	so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason
525.53	529.95	Participant	you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it
531.07	533.05	Participant	just that kinda really just makes me mad
531.52	531.82	Ellie	uh huh
534.72	535.15	Ellie	okay
535.69	537.15	Ellie	what do you do when you're annoyed
538.97	548.77	Participant	when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either  
549.89	551.08	Participant	you know verbally just
553.08	554.56	Participant	cutting 'em with a quip or
555.05	555.57	Participant	you know
556.08	559.01	Participant	i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody
560.24	562.79	Participant	but i'll try to you know
563.66	571.44	Participant	if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works 
570.16	571.67	Ellie	has that gotten you in trouble
572.89	577.42	Participant	not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to
578.25	579.73	Participant	get them to leave me alone
580.97	581.45	Participant	um
586.16	594.63	Participant	so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction
595.09	604.01	Participant	and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if 
595.34	595.69	Ellie	uh huh
604.98	607.26	Participant	it's is trouble it's usually trouble that
608.03	614.89	Participant	it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of 
615.95	619.86	Participant	so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it
620.5	621	Ellie	okay
622.31	625.28	Ellie	when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
626.71	629.18	Participant	uh the last time i argued with somebody
630.99	631.21	Participant	like
632.4	637.41	Participant	person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my
636.72	637.8	Ellie	whatever comes to your mind
639.07	641.64	Participant	uh the last thing i can think of was
643.23	643.76	Participant	i
644.43	649.33	Participant	argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia
650.11	657.47	Participant	and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a
658.07	663.78	Participant	i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature
664.55	670.92	Participant	but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her 
667.67	668.04	Ellie	yeah
672.08	677	Participant	and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us
677.55	689.47	Participant	because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process 
690.09	690.41	Ellie	yeah
690.45	697.4	Participant	but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like
697.9	705.24	Participant	i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that
706.24	706.43	Participant	it
707.25	707.91	Participant	brings you
708.73	718.79	Participant	a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened
719.32	723.61	Participant	when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it 
724.06	729.04	Participant	and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it
730.13	733.97	Participant	but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her
734.55	742.79	Participant	yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually
743.42	743.82	Ellie	yeah
743.42	751.05	Participant	and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care
751.83	757.08	Participant	but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad
757.79	761.23	Participant	but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore
761.85	770.48	Participant	so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do
771.19	781.18	Participant	i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that
774.89	775.22	Ellie	uh huh
782.48	785.26	Participant	so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's
786.68	788.95	Participant	a dual effort it's very much a dual effort
789.81	793.2	Participant	but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like
795.31	798.77	Participant	a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but
799.78	801.26	Participant	lively discussion <laughter>
801.72	803.05	Participant	you know than debate
802.06	802.48	Ellie	i see
804.62	805.99	Ellie	that sounds really hard
807.28	807.64	Participant	meh
808.98	812.76	Participant	it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever
813.56	817.49	Participant	and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you
818.06	821.34	Participant	so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy
822.06	824.69	Participant	but you deal with it and you you move on
825.7	826.08	Ellie	yeah
827.64	829.96	Ellie	who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
831.04	834.66	Participant	uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother
835.27	840.47	Participant	'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually
843.12	845.4	Participant	gave me a lot of confidence
846.13	848.56	Participant	and but were realistic about it
849.76	852.03	Participant	so i mean i think i have sort of a
853.08	862.89	Participant	realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over
863.67	863.99	Ellie	uh huh
863.74	871.37	Participant	and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life
872.01	877.4	Participant	and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed  
878.96	879.74	Ellie	that's great
882.36	883.38	Ellie	is there anything you regret
886.04	892.7	Participant	i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions
893.56	903.46	Participant	now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home
904.14	905.71	Participant	my focus was to get her home
904.7	905.06	Ellie	yeah
906.66	916.48	Participant	so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year
916.95	920.19	Participant	eating just horrible foods when i did eat
920.94	923.94	Participant	so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick 
924.67	926.83	Participant	and i'm wondering well if i didn't
927.4	934.78	Participant	if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded
935.96	939.64	Participant	would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em
940.4	944.07	Participant	and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she 
944.97	952.71	Participant	uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and
953.62	955.54	Participant	her health insurance provider missed that
956.34	957.57	Participant	so she wound up having
956.6	957.02	Ellie	wow
958.52	959.59	Participant	sort of this whole
961.08	964.31	Participant	catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down
965.04	969.95	Participant	she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke
970.71	978.03	Participant	and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her
979.54	980.24	Participant	and i know
981.32	987.98	Participant	there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her
989.18	993.48	Participant	if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have
994.28	994.63	Ellie	yeah
995.56	997.77	Ellie	do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself
998.7	1001.8	Participant	oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's
1002.4	1004.22	Participant	my desire to take responsibility
1005.12	1013.02	Participant	for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really
1013.88	1017.4	Participant	direct them into my own vision because they're their own
1018.8	1020.06	Participant	individual beings
1021.22	1023.06	Participant	and they can't you know
1023.94	1026.37	Participant	be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be
1027.64	1029.88	Participant	but i still have you know my ideals
1030.43	1038.61	Participant	and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too 
1041.78	1043.41	Participant	fit into my life
1044.28	1050.32	Participant	in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings
1050.86	1058.26	Participant	and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well
1056.14	1056.54	Ellie	mhm
1058.71	1065.39	Participant	is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs
1065.95	1070.92	Participant	and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but 
1066.09	1066.44	Ellie	yeah
1072.24	1072.74	Participant	it's still

1088.5	1090.1	Participant	ten or twenty years ago
1095.9	1103.27	Participant	probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she
1104.28	1111.9	Participant	got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her
1112.41	1116.25	Participant	and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside 
1117.04	1128.92	Participant	the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years
1125.3	1125.62	Ellie	uh huh
1129.89	1130.37	Participant	so
1131	1132.77	Participant	i think i i probably would've done that
1133.86	1139.69	Participant	um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate
1141.4	1145.63	Participant	your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family
1146.3	1156.54	Participant	to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself   
1154.02	1154.4	Ellie	mhm
1157.02	1158.58	Participant	ten years ago <laughter>
1158.72	1159.1	Ellie	okay

1166.6	1168.39	Ellie	have you been diagnosed with depression
1169.12	1174.12	Participant	no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know
1175.84	1176.68	Participant	and i mean it's not
1177.42	1183.42	Participant	i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances
1184.24	1190.23	Participant	and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment
1191.36	1192.13	Participant	and of it gets <ge>
1191.57	1192.84	Ellie	can you give me an example of that
1194.1	1194.63	Participant	um
1196.1	1204.42	Participant	after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know
1205.84	1209.48	Participant	if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't
1210.31	1210.61	Participant	but
1212.4	1214.15	Participant	how could i convince myself of that
1215.46	1218.8	Participant	um two weeks after she died i wound up with
1220.32	1221.61	Participant	pulmonary embolisms
1222.3	1230.13	Participant	in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if
1230.77	1237.97	Participant	you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um
1238.54	1240.78	Participant	i mean i wound up having to take more medication
1241.51	1242.34	Participant	because of that
1243.26	1247.21	Participant	uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to
1248.02	1253.6	Participant	get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like
1255.56	1260.61	Participant	the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so
1259.82	1260.23	Ellie	yeah
1261.36	1271.56	Participant	that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore 
1272.28	1272.83	Participant	so
1273.34	1283.29	Participant	and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just
1284.52	1286.78	Participant	you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now
1288.02	1288.42	Participant	and it
1289.39	1290.06	Participant	it's been
1291.44	1294.57	Participant	a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up
1295.76	1298.87	Participant	just stay in bed and sleep all day you know
1299.6	1300.1	Participant	but then
1301.24	1302.55	Participant	realizing that
1304.7	1311.55	Participant	when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well
1312.58	1319.29	Participant	they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies
1319.62	1319.96	Ellie	uh huh
1320.52	1322.58	Participant	i took that responsibility of doing it for them
1323.82	1336.65	Participant	so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't
1337.48	1337.95	Ellie	yeah
1337.56	1338.87	Participant	they didn't you know so
1339.62	1342.35	Participant	they eh they actually got me up and
1344.92	1356.81	Participant	and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them
1357.56	1360.66	Participant	if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been
1361.65	1364.36	Participant	you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably 
1364.96	1371.91	Participant	and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for 
1372.84	1377.28	Participant	for me i mean for me making selfish decisions  
1374.04	1374.42	Ellie	mhm
1378.03	1386.16	Participant	so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is
1386.79	1396.74	Participant	to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care  
1397.15	1400.15	Participant	as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but
1401.27	1403.26	Participant	i have a family to look after now 
1404.28	1406.03	Participant	so i have to go out and do things 
1406.49	1406.89	Ellie	yeah
1406.65	1411.97	Participant	you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know  
1412.55	1418.76	Participant	but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm  
1419.45	1421.88	Participant	been working on on a balance of the two
1422.5	1423.44	Ellie	how hard is that 
1425	1427.84	Participant	very <laughter> but it's worth it
1428.74	1429.23	Participant	i mean 
1430.57	1437.75	Participant	it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter> 
1438.46	1440.03	Participant	but keeping
1441.07	1443.84	Participant	a residence down paying bills things like that 
1446.05	1454.18	Participant	it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that 
1454.8	1455.27	Ellie	yeah
1455.38	1456.86	Participant	and i and and i know that 
1457.73	1458.05	Participant	but 
1458.7	1461.38	Participant	it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up 
1462.11	1462.59	Participant	but then 
1463.52	1465.49	Participant	it's like well what's the alternative 
1467.02	1469.44	Participant	i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life 
1470.24	1477.03	Participant	'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna 
1477.85	1483.33	Participant	be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever 
1484.28	1485.5	Participant	and i wouldn't get anything done 
1486.6	1487.13	Ellie	i see
1488.19	1489.72	Ellie	how have you been feeling lately 
1490.94	1491.98	Participant	uh very 
1492.74	1496.78	Participant	anxious and nervous and i mean what if 
1498.04	1499.17	Participant	i don't find 
1500.56	1506.7	Participant	enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um 
1508.52	1509.94	Participant	you know what what if i can't  
1511.62	1511.99	Participant	keep
1513.19	1521.03	Participant	a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but 
1522.31	1525.1	Participant	what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs 
1525.93	1532.2	Participant	and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that 
1532.76	1534.84	Participant	but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in 
1535.87	1537.33	Participant	so that's actually 
1538.62	1540.19	Participant	a source of 
1541.93	1542.69	Participant	anxiety 
1543.93	1550.67	Participant	but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it 
1551.97	1553.66	Participant	but i i i know it it's a cycle
1552.65	1553.19	Ellie	that's good 
1554.34	1561.17	Participant	and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is
1562.37	1564.25	Participant	the fundamental thing i need to take of here 
1565.33	1570.21	Participant	i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what
1571.05	1574.15	Participant	is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue 
1574.62	1575.07	Ellie	mhm
1575.13	1575.63	Participant	and so 
1576.77	1580.39	Participant	figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit
1581.05	1584.52	Participant	but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again 
1585.3	1586.67	Participant	mm i'll have to 
1587.97	1588.32	Participant	uh 
1589.62	1599.5	Participant	figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it  
1600.2	1602.11	Participant	you get over it pretty quickly you get through it 
1602.79	1603.29	Ellie	yes
1604.98	1607.48	Ellie	when was the last time you felt really happy 
1609.02	1610.94	Participant	the last time i felt really happy
1613.2	1613.84	Participant	i don't know
1614.66	1614.99	Participant	zz
1617.84	1618.59	Participant	um
1622.65	1622.87	Participant	i 
1626.35	1631.21	Participant	huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me 
1632.17	1638.09	Participant	because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda
1638.89	1640.1	Participant	eh in the middle
1641.07	1641.5	Participant	um
1642.89	1646.75	Participant	really like overjoyously happy i don't know 
1648.46	1652.78	Participant	i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened
1655.22	1655.7	Ellie	okay 
1657.88	1659.46	Ellie	how would your best friend describe you 
1663.93	1665.14	Participant	i don't know you don't know 
1666.08	1668.33	Participant	perceptions of other people i mean 
1671.34	1673.3	Participant	probably as somebody who 
1676.55	1681.15	Participant	oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know 
1682.48	1685.46	Participant	handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that  
1685.99	1686.32	Participant	at all
1687.58	1688.12	Participant	and it's a it
1687.85	1690.19	Ellie	what would you say are some of your best qualities 
1691.83	1695.3	Participant	probably that i can think on my feet and
1695.94	1697.67	Participant	i'm not afraid to 
1699.01	1703.6	Participant	hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done 
1704.76	1705.69	Participant	um that 
1707.26	1709.37	Participant	and i can do it creatively and i try to 
1710.59	1711.91	Participant	strive for balance 
1712.44	1712.76	Participant	probably 
1714.16	1715.72	Participant	probably the best things about me <laughter> 
1716.57	1716.98	Ellie	uh huh
1717.37	1718.29	Ellie	that's great
1720.07	1721.92	Ellie	what are you most proud of in your life 
1723.6	1729.67	Participant	that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not 
1730.51	1730.98	Participant	um
1732.65	1740.61	Participant	you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to 
1741.24	1745.25	Participant	who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got
1746.19	1748.39	Participant	a career that she 
1749.79	1751.79	Participant	it's more of a job that she fell into 
1752.74	1759.27	Participant	'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer 
1753.04	1753.43	Ellie	uh huh
1759.71	1763.65	Participant	and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time  
1764.99	1769.7	Participant	but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and
1770.3	1774.3	Participant	she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda
1775.65	1778.63	Participant	stole all the money from her business so she lost her business  
1779.2	1783.98	Participant	and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early 
1779.33	1779.84	Ellie	uh oh 
1784.46	1789.16	Participant	she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it  
1789.82	1793.28	Participant	and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it 
1793.93	1794.41	Ellie	yeah
1794.6	1797.2	Participant	and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is 
1798.26	1803.45	Participant	yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can 
1803.88	1809.18	Participant	be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me 
1810.35	1812.38	Participant	people i actually like in my life and 
1813.19	1814.15	Participant	be happy with that 
1815.04	1817.13	Participant	and i see a lot of people who aren't 
1817.78	1824.21	Participant	and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that 
1825.11	1825.47	Ellie	yeah 
1825.11	1831.98	Participant	and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now
1832.53	1833.01	Ellie	mhm
1833.83	1835.21	Ellie	that's so good to hear
