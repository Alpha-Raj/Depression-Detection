141.31	147.23	Participant	uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly
149.27	150.31	Ellie	are you still working in that
151.31	152.48	Participant	yes i am actually
154.45	155.14	Ellie	what do you do now
156.24	165.52	Participant	right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire
167.12	167.61	Ellie	awesome
168.6	169.04	Participant	impressive
169.01	170.03	Ellie	what's your dream job

192.68	202.2	Participant	the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know
203.19	204.49	Participant	he's the first one who taught me that
205.83	208.49	Participant	school was not about a grade but about learning

411.59	415.39	Participant	i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is
416.17	422.4	Participant	it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think
422.97	431.42	Participant	and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway
432.08	432.58	Participant	that type of thing
436.45	438.93	Ellie	what are some things that usually put you in a good mood

447.58	448.07	Participant	um
448.64	456.2	Participant	what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood
458.16	458.84	Ellie	nice
459.69	460.08	Participant	thank you

488.22	489.52	Participant	when you start off in school
490.37	497.08	Participant	you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
497.78	498.27	Participant	and
498.85	502.37	Participant	you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it
502.95	506.62	Participant	and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you
507.37	519.27	Participant	as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
523.23	523.58	Ellie	yeah
525.83	526.18	Participant	okay
525.88	528.34	Ellie	when was the last time you felt really happy
