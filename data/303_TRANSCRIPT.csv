526.306	531.606	Participant	that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that
532.826	533.886	Participant	i probably would've
534.776	546.006	Participant	stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um
546.916	553.796	Participant	rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um
554.516	562.826	Participant	education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day
