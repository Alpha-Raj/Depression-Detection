898.61	901.09	Participant	went over what we had done and
901.65	908.96	Participant	you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and
909.56	915.11	Participant	i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh
916	921.91	Participant	it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um
922.95	929.84	Participant	i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh

938.82	946.72	Participant	you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that
947.51	954.83	Participant	the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but
