465.03	470.6	Participant	something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled

474.94	481.11	Participant	trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person
481.6	488.88	Participant	thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged

528.08	534.9	Participant	doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um
535.52	539.79	Participant	uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um
540.26	546.17	Participant	but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let
546.67	553.15	Participant	uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so
553.97	554.85	Participant	just my thoughts there
555.473	555.913	Ellie	yeah_downer (yeah)
557.626	561.3	Ellie	hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)

573.17	576.25	Participant	uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh
576.85	583.18	Participant	ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh
581.281	581.671	Ellie	right2 (right)
583.68	585.78	Participant	break up with her after some stuff happened and
586.34	592.08	Participant	um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to
592.66	594	Participant	uh to uh
594.75	596.89	Participant	break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh
597.43	608.5	Participant	uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory
609.085	610.515	Ellie	change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
611.01	612.05	Participant	ugh just
612.79	618.56	Participant	a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so
619	628.31	Participant	uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um
628.85	629.56	Participant	i uh
630.1	635.32	Participant	yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now

651.63	661.57	Participant	but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or
661.96	673.11	Participant	um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very
673.56	679.26	Participant	big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh
679.74	685.56	Participant	uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i
686.02	690.03	Participant	if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so

707.83	717.09	Participant	um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little
717.58	718.23	Participant	um
718.79	720.96	Participant	uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh
721.56	731.39	Participant	um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of
731.82	739.84	Participant	the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a
740.58	743.34	Participant	group of people or or company um
744.01	752.95	Participant	carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee

776.47	784.38	Participant	how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and
784.73	788.31	Participant	you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the
788.78	798.74	Participant	uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it

833.72	836.66	Participant	follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel
837.28	841.3	Participant	um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that
841.923	842.433	Ellie	mhm (mhm)

849.82	858.21	Participant	uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh
859.72	866.18	Participant	and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself
866.75	872.28	Participant	but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist
872.852	874.002	Ellie	symptoms_what (what were your symptoms)
875.08	882.15	Participant	uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all

889.16	895.66	Participant	cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a
896.34	897.5	Participant	a symptom so um

911.77	912.29	Participant	um
913.04	916.07	Participant	i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and
916.51	920.12	Participant	i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good
920.66	926.17	Participant	good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly
926.55	933.01	Participant	and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that
933.45	938.59	Participant	uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so
939.542	940.992	Ellie	therapy_useful (do you feel like therapy is useful)
941.32	947.38	Participant	oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't
947.9	958.51	Participant	you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis
960.5	960.96	Ellie	okay_confirm (okay)
962.74	966.866	Ellie	memory_erase (tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory)

979.48	984.72	Participant	uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me
985.05	989.06	Participant	and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very
990.29	999.18	Participant	kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child
999.5	1003.18	Participant	i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to
1003.86	1006.61	Participant	um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh
1007.19	1014.33	Participant	um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of
1015.43	1021.39	Participant	you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with
