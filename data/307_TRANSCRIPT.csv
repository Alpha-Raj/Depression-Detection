381.08	382.77	Participant	and so and
383.22	389.81	Participant	so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy
390.06	401.69	Participant	and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
390.24	391.63	Ellie	[laughter]

453.177	454.698	Participant	 my dream job
455.9	464.492	Participant	i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end
464.638	466.518	Participant	i guess it's something that i realized
466.847	468.307	Participant	i like to see
469.442	491.958	Participant	the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
480.566	481.076	Ellie	mhm
490.656	491.166	Ellie	yeah
492.49	496.03	Participant	something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography

543.19	544.8	Ellie	what do you enjoy about traveling
545.626	552.823	Participant	in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and
553.62	564.223	Participant	see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to
565.23	566.55	Participant	stir things up
567.135	568.335	Ellie	i see what you mean
569.414	571.234	Ellie	i'd love to hear about one of your trips
572.729	576.733	Participant	oh gosh okay um
577.353	578.623	Participant	i'm trying to think
579.267	580.507	Participant	one of my trips
584.346	592.316	Participant	i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is
592.552	601.059	Participant	one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
600.517	601.487	Ellie	oh my gosh
601.477	612.473	Participant	i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places
612.755	625.621	Participant	i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so
626.059	626.699	Participant	um
627.139	637.448	Participant	and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made
637.791	645.129	Participant	and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like
645.913	654.185	Participant	white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful
654.34	655.94	Participant	or something that's different too
656.232	657.122	Ellie	yeah
657.246	658.206	Ellie	i see what you mean
661.116	661.896	Participant	cool

665.498	666.538	Participant	um
668.048	670.124	Participant	pretty easy as long as I
672.057	674.689	Participant	get well no i always sleep so easy
675.566	677.486	Ellie	what are you like when you don't sleep well
678.375	688.813	Participant	oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world
689.66	691.21	Ellie	do you feel that way often
691.875	698.066	Participant	i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of 
698.424	701.344	Participant	energizing me so no it's not too bad
701.79	702.7	Participant	that's good
703.555	706.965	Ellie	have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
709.758	722.85	Participant	uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in
723.416	724.266	Participant	so
725.739	730.384	Participant	it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
730.375	730.985	Ellie	yeah
731.474	733.744	Ellie	it can be tough to find a good job these days
733.861	749.684	Participant	yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
743.769	744.359	Ellie	mhm
749.98	761.131	Participant	so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck
761.508	766.426	Participant	barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like
767.282	774.782	Participant	when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
774.85	776.41	Ellie	that sounds really hard
776.759	782.55	Participant	yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so
782.906	800.323	Participant	but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh
801.222	805.167	Participant	all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
806.5	807.03	Ellie	yeah
808.36	809.49	Ellie	do you feel down
810.629	817.036	Participant	uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]
816.911	817.531	Ellie	nice
818.194	818.684	Participant	yes
819.293	822.278	Participant	but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because
822.278	824.318	Participant	i'm just trying to find like what
824.954	841.311	Participant	i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries
841.522	852.068	Participant	so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation
852.239	853.139	Ellie	yeah
853.319	854.259	Ellie	i'm sorry
854.589	855.489	Participant	it's all good
856.02	858.08	Ellie	have you been diagnosed with depression
859.168	862.419	Participant	uh no i don't think so but i mean
862.742	866.134	Participant	i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can
866.374	870.159	Participant	but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds
870.438	871.198	Ellie	okay

885.505	886.855	Participant	oh let's see
887.114	892.455	Participant	uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail
893.177	901.414	Participant	'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home
901.93	909.236	Participant	so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it
909.938	910.488	Participant	so
910.893	912.143	Participant	ten years ago

916.69	921.14	Participant	 [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act
921.385	931.62	Participant	i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time
932.115	936.379	Participant	and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it
936.639	941.599	Participant	and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes 
942.396	948.93	Participant	um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just
949.25	956.18	Participant	expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder
956.526	961.406	Participant	kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good
961.683	963.683	Participant	i don't try to go above that
964.111	965.411	Participant	if that makes any sense

1006.843	1007.603	Participant	[laughter]
1008.184	1010.074	Participant	that's a tough question
1012.065	1016.8	Participant	um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college
1017.286	1017.876	Participant	um
1018.914	1024.34	Participant	i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east
