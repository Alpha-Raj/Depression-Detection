252.03	262.98	Participant	uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go

285.16	287.71	Participant	you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's
288.25	293.32	Participant	hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one
293.67	298.2	Participant	and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy
298.57	308.94	Participant	mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure
309.26	317.98	Participant	even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time
318.46	326.45	Participant	and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy

366.42	368.17	Participant	i guess you really have to put yourself
369.28	374.37	Participant	in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy
376.553	377.493	Ellie	difficult (how hard is that)
378.87	383.59	Participant	um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're

506.1	516.66	Participant	<tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited
517.32	518.65	Participant	and um
519	521.76	Participant	and he said something about are you aware of
522.57	523.96	Participant	past lives and
524.52	528.68	Participant	i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that
529.34	538.96	Participant	if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them
539.301	539.831	Ellie	yeah2 (yeah)
539.39	541.65	Participant	and i and he said that are you aware that
542.53	543.36	Participant	um
543.67	547.19	Participant	<tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that
547.61	553.54	Participant	many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have
554.44	560.42	Participant	had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness
560.94	564.91	Participant	um resulting from even your past relationships or your
565.24	574.02	Participant	parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that
574.88	582.42	Participant	you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself
582.9	586.31	Participant	even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold
586.87	590.76	Participant	maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all
591.1	593.98	Participant	and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge
594.46	595.17	Participant	i take
595.71	599.53	Participant	sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would
600.17	601.68	Participant	fold down i had my boo boo
602.05	604.39	Participant	and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part
606.04	610.11	Participant	you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child
607.513	607.903	Ellie	right2 (right)
610.66	612.4	Participant	and i would actually
612.96	618.16	Participant	even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back
618.51	621.78	Participant	i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital
622.44	626.56	Participant	the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that
626.93	634.67	Participant	just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh
635.48	636.08	Participant	um
637.48	642.68	Participant	uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that
643.68	650.88	Participant	because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and
651.29	654.83	Participant	it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was
655.63	661.85	Participant	um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen
662.34	671.1	Participant	twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have
671.44	675.37	Participant	never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has
675.889	676.419	Ellie	yeah2 (yeah)
676	676.4	Participant	you know
676.82	680.51	Participant	so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of
681.37	685.45	Participant	somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his
686.96	687.48	Participant	uh
687.89	694.58	Participant	you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated
695.132	695.602	Ellie	yeah3 (yeah)
696.19	701.69	Participant	especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery
696.492	697.442	Ellie	understand (i understand)
702.57	703.9	Participant	uh the following week
704.22	706.97	Participant	and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get
707.47	708.19	Participant	into it but
708.73	720.05	Participant	one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused
720.3	721.65	Participant	by people themselves
722.21	726.98	Participant	and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that
727.88	729.97	Participant	past lives can also affect
730.64	735.1	Participant	you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are
736.32	743.59	Participant	are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought
744.15	748.2	Participant	he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so
748.64	749.74	Participant	but um
750.39	753.1	Participant	<tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't
753.47	756.17	Participant	you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>
755.987	756.457	Ellie	yeah3 (yeah)
