335.078	335.908	Ellie	i understand
336.978	338.478	Ellie	do you consider yourself an introvert
339.648	340.278	Participant	what do you mean

381.198	382.278	Participant	who's been a positive <pos>
384.158	392.208	Participant	i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and
393.298	402.478	Participant	which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't
402.718	403.098	Ellie	mhm
403.148	409.858	Participant	it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so
410.938	416.708	Participant	i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there
418.748	419.318	Ellie	like what
420.078	436.018	Participant	you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently
436.528	443.208	Participant	instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time
444.388	444.738	Ellie	mmm
445.238	445.748	Ellie	that's good
448.588	450.428	Ellie	how are you at controlling your temper
451.948	455.628	Participant	um i guess it depends on who you talk to
457.468	458.208	Ellie	<laughter>
457.888	463.068	Participant	i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that
464.048	464.648	Participant	um
465.538	469.728	Participant	i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it
470.858	472.138	Ellie	can you give me an example of that
473.298	484.118	Participant	well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me
484.988	489.698	Participant	but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress
490.438	495.248	Participant	lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better
497.098	497.688	Ellie	that's good
501.898	503.618	Ellie	have you been diagnosed with depression
504.238	504.628	Participant	no
505.798	507.738	Ellie	have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
508.218	508.618	Participant	no
509.498	511.028	Ellie	have you ever served in the military
511.298	511.628	Participant	no
512.738	513.138	Ellie	okay
515.378	516.408	Ellie	is there anything you regret
518.208	519.448	Participant	um
520.658	521.578	Participant	nothing major
522.448	533.018	Participant	i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean
533.708	540.138	Participant	those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know
541.278	552.838	Participant	but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but
553.538	559.818	Participant	but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so
560.518	560.828	Ellie	right
561.808	563.778	Ellie	there are always trade offs in life aren't there
563.948	564.398	Participant	yeah
565.188	566.548	Ellie	what made you decide to do that
565.218	565.468	Participant	so
567.718	568.748	Participant	um i think
569.918	570.658	Participant	i think my
571.488	573.608	Participant	in my life i knew that
574.368	590.858	Participant	i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with
591.348	595.318	Participant	so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of
596.498	598.648	Participant	mmm kind of answered itself so
599.658	600.998	Ellie	that sounds really hard
602.078	616.388	Participant	no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense
616.738	631.878	Participant	it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you
633.018	633.288	Ellie	right
633.918	634.848	Ellie	that makes sense
638.598	640.838	Ellie	what's one of your most memorable experiences
642.398	646.818	Participant	memorable experiences um hmm
650.488	665.948	Participant	i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that
667.058	679.768	Participant	i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able
680.588	688.298	Participant	i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like
689.468	690.498	Participant	i've gotten somewhere
691.578	692.328	Ellie	that's great
691.628	700.358	Participant	maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire
701.508	701.878	Ellie	yeah
703.828	704.628	Ellie	i see what you mean
704.798	705.218	Participant	yeah

733.908	742.868	Participant	i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so
743.548	745.318	Participant	i guess to answer the question probably
746.718	753.888	Participant	mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy
755.188	755.978	Ellie	that's great
757.798	759.348	Ellie	how would your best friend describe you
760.978	766.638	Participant	i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends
