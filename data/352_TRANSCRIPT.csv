200.58	201.17	Participant	um
201.95	210.24	Participant	it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like
210.81	217.36	Participant	like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it

287.72	292.77	Participant	probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda
293.3	304.06	Participant	um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter>

307.41	316.8	Participant	yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go
317.2	327.36	Participant	travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool 
328.34	329.77	Ellie	what do you enjoy about traveling 
331.08	337.41	Participant	uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um
337.77	344.63	Participant	because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's
344.99	353.24	Participant	all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the
354.06	359.04	Participant	diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool 
362.6	364.2	Ellie	have you ever served in the military

370.92	372.64	Ellie	have you been diagnosed with depression 
373.52	383.01	Participant	no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've
383.85	388.97	Participant	i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah  
390.5	392.69	Ellie	how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep 
394.46	403.28	Participant	lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep
403.71	414.29	Participant	or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  
415.42	417	Ellie	what are you like when you don't sleep well 
417.84	429.07	Participant	i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function 
430.8	432.23	Ellie	how have you been feeling lately 
433.54	435.83	Participant	i've been feeling really good um 
436.71	441.92	Participant	over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and
442.25	451.84	Participant	that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through
452.26	464.4	Participant	a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and
464.97	468.95	Participant	so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>
469.97	473.1	Ellie	have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately 
474.31	479.85	Participant	um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more 
480.3	488.31	Participant	positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and
488.83	492.03	Participant	of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to
492.75	493.21	Participant	kind of
494.26	502.92	Participant	just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more
503.71	510.19	Participant	confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>   
511.32	513.86	Ellie	when was the last time you felt really happy 
515.12	519.44	Participant	oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um 
520.31	525.44	Participant	i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and
525.85	533.27	Participant	it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and
533.88	542.01	Participant	um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just
542.21	549.08	Participant	like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> 
550.78	552.28	Ellie	how would your best friend describe you 
553.34	557.61	Participant	my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and
558.36	560.45	Participant	bold and fearless um
561.42	562.68	Participant	that i'm unique
563.35	564.94	Participant	and artistic
565.58	577.99	Participant	and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> 
579.75	581.33	Ellie	what are you most proud of in your life 
582.92	583.59	Participant	um 
585.06	585.61	Participant	probably
586.55	587.51	Participant	just like
588.27	596.1	Participant	the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very
596.81	602.74	Participant	exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and
603.25	614.31	Participant	i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and
614.54	626.33	Participant	i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles 
627.34	628.38	Ellie	is there anything you regret 
630.33	642.72	Participant	oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so
643.27	644.99	Participant	i wouldn't really change anything 
646.28	649.04	Ellie	what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
651.15	652.24	Participant	oh <sigh>
653.33	657.04	Participant	i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i 
658.27	665.67	Participant	should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because
666.26	666.68	Participant	um
667.43	676.92	Participant	i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just
677.47	681.79	Participant	tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do 
684.15	687.46	Ellie	tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed 
688.65	689.37	Participant	oh 
691.31	694.12	Participant	let's see that's kind of hard <laughter> 
695.31	697.5	Participant	um oh i guess
698.35	708.53	Participant	i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since
708.73	713.25	Participant	i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so
713.82	720.61	Participant	um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun 
722.49	724.83	Ellie	okay i think i've asked everything i need to
725.35	725.71	Participant	cool
725.78	727.31	Ellie	thanks for sharing your thoughts with me 
727.84	728.35	Participant	you're welcome
