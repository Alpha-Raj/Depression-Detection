684.26	687.21	Participant	like they don't have any boundaries
689.46	693.76	Participant	and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child
694.27	696.75	Participant	they let my child boss 'em around and stuff
697.65	699.66	Participant	anyways because of this

730.11	738.99	Participant	more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us
739.92	740.73	Participant	and
741.66	748.13	Participant	with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild
748.69	750.21	Participant	and have everything that he wants
750.77	755.79	Participant	and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes
756.23	759.74	Participant	and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules
760.41	761.14	Participant	and not
