1094.367	1099.79	Participant	and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in
1100.26	1103.21	Participant	the birth the bringing of new life into this world so
1103.66	1105.6	Participant	i would say that's probably
1106.005	1108.655	Participant	was my was a dream job and i didn't know it
1108.935	1113.485	Participant	i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um
1114.365	1119.04	Participant	was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore
1119.19	1121.46	Participant	actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed
1121.82	1122.61	Participant	but um
1123.5	1125.57	Participant	i like i said i do it for family members
1126.15	1127.65	Ellie	what made you decide to do that
1128.325	1129.495	Participant	um
1129.915	1132.575	Participant	i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident
1132.65	1137.65	Participant	she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children
1138.47	1139.85	Participant	and um
1139.955	1144.685	Participant	i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends
1145.275	1146.225	Participant	and
1146.665	1151.31	Participant	her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave
1151.54	1156.695	Participant	i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth
1157.275	1159.195	Participant	which is a whole different experience
1159.69	1164.69	Participant	so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery
1165.02	1165.45	Ellie	uh huh
1165.47	1170.65	Participant	but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you
1171.32	1175.965	Participant	even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like
1177.095	1180.445	Participant	so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood
1180.565	1183.215	Participant	um about fifteen years ago
1183.325	1186.345	Participant	'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old
1186.83	1187.9	Participant	so um
1188.89	1189.34	Participant	yeah
1190.42	1190.96	Participant	and i've been
1190.965	1191.965	Ellie	how hard is that
1192.86	1193.85	Participant	um
1194.03	1197.98	Participant	well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but
1198.65	1200.58	Participant	uh and you know also like
1200.8	1207.89	Participant	for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business
1208.36	1216.12	Participant	and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me
1216.6	1223.645	Participant	so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the
1224.037	1224.527	Participant	um
1225.687	1230.807	Participant	the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby
1231.017	1234.507	Participant	i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter] 
1234.597	1236.287	Participant	it was in the middle of the night she was like 
1236.297	1236.727	Ellie	wow
1236.797	1240.677	Participant	two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter]
1241.262	1242.242	Participant	so um
1241.862	1242.542	Ellie	[laughter]
1242.537	1244.557	Participant	it went really fast but other than that
1244.802	1245.802	Participant	you know um
1247.577	1251.842	Participant	yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do
1252.492	1254.622	Ellie	what's one of your most memorable experiences
1255.89	1256.86	Participant	um
1258.84	1261.675	Participant	in all of life or in your job
1262.265	1263.415	Ellie	whatever comes to your mind
1263.795	1266.255	Participant	uh probably my my own birth
1266.56	1268.73	Participant	i mean my the birth of my own children
1269.89	1271.51	Ellie	how did you feel in that moment
1272.555	1273.635	Participant	um
1274.09	1275.55	Participant	like there's an extreme
1276.525	1280.025	Participant	sense of joy excitement relief
1280.24	1282.02	Participant	because of course you're out of the pain
1282.715	1286.81	Participant	and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know
1287.11	1288.75	Participant	going forward from there but it's
1289.595	1293.715	Participant	it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome
1294.315	1295.495	Participant	after you give birth
1297.13	1299.12	Ellie	that sounds like a great situation
1297.19	1300.125	Participant	and i have experienced both ways i've done both um
1300.632	1301.642	Participant	natural and
1301.992	1305.102	Participant	my last child was via c_section so i've had both
1305.872	1308.182	Participant	both um experiences
1309.692	1310.262	Ellie	mhm
1312.632	1313.932	Ellie	is there anything you regret
1315.157	1316.197	Participant	um
1318.892	1322.432	Participant	i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little
1323.047	1327.397	Participant	psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny
1328.087	1329.007	Ellie	[laughter]

1328.092	1329.892	Participant	and um she
1330.757	1335.402	Participant	she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was
1336.242	1339.642	Participant	born very quickly after he broke the water and oof
1340.277	1343.787	Participant	my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble
1344.547	1346.977	Participant	because i only had like two contractions after that
1347.087	1348.067	Ellie	oh no
1347.352	1348.802	Participant	my daughter was born in the bed
1349.602	1352.672	Participant	so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but
1353.522	1355.502	Participant	um i'm sure they weren't happy
1355.727	1357.597	Participant	to fill out a lot of paper work after that
1358.677	1359.127	Ellie	yeah
1358.677	1359.127	Participant	so
1360.987	1364.027	Ellie	what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
1366.802	1369.512	Participant	now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago
1370.782	1371.682	Participant	um
1375.517	1377.827	Participant	ten or twenty years ago i was probably more
1378.517	1379.667	Participant	not as um
1380.127	1382.367	Participant	relaxed not as um
1383.782	1386.672	Participant	like i feel now at my age that um
1389.262	1393.732	Participant	i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about
1394.342	1398.672	Participant	uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what
1399.042	1399.622	Participant	you know
1400.057	1405.752	Participant	you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care
1406.287	1412.322	Participant	you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever
1412.844	1417.129	Participant	so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that
1417.639	1422.404	Participant	you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
1423.384	1424.234	Ellie	that makes sense
1426.824	1428.614	Participant	what are you most proud of in your life
1429.404	1431.364	Participant	most proud of um
1432.864	1436.004	Participant	probably my family my my husband and my
1436.419	1439.924	Participant	my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've
1440.124	1442.194	Participant	we're an in tact family that
1442.494	1442.944	Participant	um
1443.504	1445.904	Participant	my kids see every day how
1446.179	1450.954	Participant	their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and
1451.644	1452.744	Participant	they um
1453.079	1454.669	Participant	they actually express
1455.069	1459.844	Participant	gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family
1460.374	1462.314	Participant	so i would say that's probably it
1462.909	1463.949	Ellie	that's great
1465.714	1468.004	Ellie	what would you say are some of your best qualities
1468.664	1469.724	Participant	um

1500.149	1503.439	Participant	and um i don't think i'm better than someone else
1504.079	1510.879	Participant	if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough
1511.794	1512.374	Ellie	yeah
