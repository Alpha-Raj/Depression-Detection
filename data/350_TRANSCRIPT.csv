716.11	716.94	Participant	to just 
717.88	731.93	Participant	relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people
732.54	739.42	Participant	because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you
739.76	750.47	Participant	are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their 
750.83	756.75	Participant	their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just
757.28	761.89	Participant	believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be 
761.64	762.03	Ellie	yeah
