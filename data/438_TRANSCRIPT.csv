524.53	527.22	Participant	i just thought that you know um
528.63	533.86	Participant	there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs
534.27	540.26	Participant	and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better
540.71	544.98	Participant	um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um
545.56	554.15	Participant	with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um
554.885	555.785	Participant	are kinda
556.225	556.625	Participant	become
557.53	559.4	Participant	you know harder to obtain
