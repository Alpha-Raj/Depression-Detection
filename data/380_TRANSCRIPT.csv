823.354	829.918	Participant	'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the
830.407	837.037	Participant	like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie
833.536	834.106	Ellie	why2 (why)
837.571	838.191	Ellie	yes (yes)
838.654	839.432	Participant	um

848.505	852.818	Participant	they have a certain uh they think that the
853.997	862.417	Participant	like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like
862.9	866.051	Participant	complexity of character within the movie
866.54	867.84	Participant	and um
868.96	870.131	Participant	that somehow like
871.37	872.961	Participant	<sigh> um
874.6	878.281	Participant	what what were they saying they were saying like the movie
883.47	886.05	Participant	it like xxx it's like the end of an era
886.471	894.25	Participant	which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they
894.66	896.43	Participant	how they interact in the plot
896.79	897.551	Participant	um
898.04	899.021	Participant	kind of like
899.99	900.751	Participant	uh
903	904.1	Participant	yeah i guess
904.75	911.54	Participant	i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's
912.05	913.081	Participant	the um
913.89	918.46	Participant	i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i
918.971	926.78	Participant	i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
922.979	923.449	Ellie	mm (mm)
927.43	930.15	Participant	in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it
930.571	939.89	Participant	um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool
940.29	940.821	Participant	um
941.36	945.46	Participant	the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
945.98	954.55	Participant	but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
954.664	955.194	Ellie	yeah2 (yeah)
954.82	957.22	Participant	and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie
957.65	961.6	Participant	and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like
962.03	964.071	Participant	so in the movie django unchained
964.44	972.371	Participant	um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big
972.991	973.131	Participant	the
973.64	975.25	Participant	big purpose of the movie is
975.403	975.793	Ellie	right2 (right)
975.73	976.481	Participant	and um
977.28	979.49	Participant	and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh
979.93	985.46	Participant	who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he
986.04	993.64	Participant	was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django
994.01	1003.65	Participant	or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera
1004.15	1004.871	Participant	and um
1005.44	1018.151	Participant	and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not
1018.651	1021.48	Participant	sacrifice themself for someone else
1021.539	1022.269	Ellie	hmmB (hmm)
1022.06	1025.52	Participant	um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like
1026.021	1026.541	Participant	um
1028.28	1029.01	Participant	like who
1029.42	1031.64	Participant	uh like
1032.48	1034.57	Participant	she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that
1035.07	1040.51	Participant	altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist
1040.83	1047.56	Participant	um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself
