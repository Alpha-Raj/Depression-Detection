25.8,26.6,yes,0.777
34.4,48.6,so I'm doing fine I just had one class today but I woke up kind of late so I was a little frantic for a few minutes but that's been a pretty good day,0.878
55.9,58.5, I'm originally from Kansas,0.765
69.5,94.9, I definitely love the weather first of all I think at least in Kansas and gets really cold during the winters so being able to have like a pretty decent winter in La where it's still sunny and just great weather is a huge bonus also I think living in a bigger city just gives you a lot more opportunities whether that's like fun and social events or even just like,0.749
96.1,102.3, academically speaking I think there's like a lot of great opportunities in a bigger city and I think Ellie's able to provide that to me,0.78
111.9,120.1, I think living in a big city has its pros and cons and at least in terms of La for me I think,0.889
122.3,131.8, it's like the traffic first of all is awful so like that's a huge thing that I don't have to deal with back home in addition to traffic I would say like,0.86
134.7,155.7, like it's not I don't know it's like not my type of City I guess in the best way possible I'm trying to phrase that but like I guess like the vibe of it isn't something necessarily love like I prefer like the Bay Area it's just something about it that I just have a better connection with,0.748
166.9,183.9, I tend to travel quite a bit of traveled a lot in the past during college it's been a little harder obviously but I've been able to travel during my brakes and I try to go home at least once a semester if I can to see my family and friends,0.839
188.8,218.2, I love being able to kind of really emerge into a new culture and meet new people and just see what it's like to kind of like exploring you City whether that's food the culture the Traditions I think just a really cool opportunity to like get a better understanding of what someone might,0.788
219.2,238, be used to another part of the world that I'm not used to growing up and I think just create a lot of long lasting memories with whoever you're with when you travel and I think it's just a great thing that I've been able to do a lot throughout my life and I hope to continue to do even in the future,0.764
247.4,273.5, so I guess my most recent trip was over spring break I went to Nicaragua with a group of students from USC through an organization called Global brigades at Marshall and basically what it is is business service trip where we go to Nicaragua and we provide financial literacy and Consulting to micro Enterprises,0.891
274.2,303.1, within the small communities and I was there for a week and I was able to create so many great memories it was so fun getting to know these 20 other people that I was with on the trip but more than that it was being able to create a great social impact on the community and being able to apply the business skills I learned in my classes more so to the real world by giving Consulting,0.908
304.3,318, to these micro Enterprises so they can so they could create more sustainability within their businesses so there's a great experience and I obviously want to go back to Nicaragua sometime again in the future,0.73
326.2,349.2, I think my most memorable experience was going to London in Fall of 2016 I was a spring admit at USC so I was able to spend my first semester abroad and so I chose London and obviously being there for like 3 to 4 months,0.809
350.3,379.7, like really makes you kind of at least for me it really helped me get a better understanding of the culture there and like meeting new people from all around the world because I went to an International College there and some of my best friends even till now or like people from London because they were my first group of college friends and it was just so fun because April I was able to visit like other countries in Europe while I was in London because of the close proximity and,0.762
381.4,389.5, it's just like a fun time being able to not have to worry too much about school but also like have a fun time with friends,0.843
398.4,427.7, I would say growing up my favorite subjects tended to switch quite a bit but I think my favorite subject was oh I love language learning languages so my favorite subject in high school was Spanish I just loved learning about it and like being able to go to these countries like Nicaragua and Guatemala Costa Rica the Dominican Republic,0.787
427.9,453.4, um was so fun because I was able to actually apply my Spanish skills and talk to the logo so it was a great time and I would say continue to love Spanish but I guess my favorite subject now would probably have to be like more so business-related like what secon or I like Finance accounting because it's my major that's what my favorite subject would be now,0.816
459.2,486.4, so currently I'm a student at USC a sophomore majoring in Business Administration and a minor and applied analytics and so I've been taking business classes for the past few semesters and I really enjoy it and after I graduate I hope to do something related to business and Tech and so yeah,0.751
500.6,529.9, I think my dream job would have to be starting my own business along the lines of something that I'm really passionate about I love the idea of having like a start-up and like really just seeing it grow and like kind of like also being part of it and like growing yourself with that company and like I was just within a start-up you're able to do so many tasks like,0.887
530.2,560, this you're forced to do so many things because it's so new and being able to like dip my feet into everything I think that's a really cool thing that I love about startups and I'm really interested in technology so like I feel like it's something that's going to always be there and it's just becoming more and more prevalent in our world so like I really want to do something where I can post start a company that has something to do with technology and business and then at the same time I think would be cool because I'm really passionate,0.801
560.1,570.1, passionate about social entrepreneurship I think it'd be cool if it would be something that kind of relieves the social impact on the world in some way or another,0.824
574.4,575.3, you can see yourself,0.624
579,590.2, I would say I'm reserved but I'm also pretty social so like I when I first meet someone I'm usually pretty open and,0.82
592.4,620.5, like I like to meet people as well but at the same time like it does take time to get to know me a little bit before I can be super outgoing but I think I'm pretty sociable and like I love going to events and just like fun things with my friends and meeting new people so I always I've been shy growing up but I feel like now become more outgoing over time,0.907
626.4,654.5, I think coming to college there's like so many new experiences new people to meet new things to explore so it's just like one of those things that have been open to so many new things that like I've just become more excited to see what else is out there and like because of that I've just become open to more things and in some ways I feel like that's pushed me to become more outgoing,0.895
654.6,655.5, in a good way,0.857
664.2,693.4, so my family they're seriously like my solid rock that always there for me I have a younger brother his name's Sean I live and then my parents who run their own business it's it business and I think that's kind of where my aspirations kind of also stem from because I've seen them do that and something that's I've always been interested in so I think in terms of Education I've always wanted to pursue business and do,0.758
693.6,722.6, Tech I think a lot of it has to do with seeing how successful they are and seeing what it's like to own a business and my family they just always been there for me for everything then we're support system I love spending time with them as much as I can it's obviously harder in college because I'm not home often but whenever I am home for the brakes I try to like maximize my time with them and just you know create fun memories whenever I'm home,0.699
727.8,756.6, I really enjoy dancing it's something that really relaxes me I joined a cultural show here on campus and it's something that I love doing because I was able to be a part of a dance and it keeps me going throughout the semester something that I look forward to being able to go to practice and meet my friends,0.791
757.5,765.3, and just like have a fun time so I would say dancing something that it's kind of my passion for it's also the thing that really relaxes me the most,0.874
773.4,802.7, I would say I'm a pretty calm person I'm really good about not letting something get to me to easily like I understand that like even if I am upset about something or mad I first try to like analyzed in my head and figure out the best way to approach it I'm not the type of person to like get necessarily like hot-headed right away because I've just seen like that and always backfire so for me it's always about,0.784
803.7,823.4, taking it step by step and first figuring out how I can confront the issue or deal with it without having to get super upset right away and like lash out at someone I rather be calm and think it through before I do anything so I don't regret anything in the future,0.88
833.6,834.5, mmm,0.619
837.1,839.9, the last thing I YouTube about,0.605
841.1,843.9, I guess most recent one was,0.812
846,875.2, my sweet man I had we just had some conflict and sometimes with getting the household items for the room there's not it's not equal the responsibilities aren't equally shared so I had just said that like maybe we should all be good about splitting their responsibilities and making sure everyone's contributing but I think it was take in some ways is taken out of,0.884
875.8,878.3, send them and then the wrong way so,0.622
880.1,907.1, I think she got really upset but like we're also not weren't we never we weren't friends to begin with we were just suitemates so we're not close or anything but it just became an unnecessary conflict when the only point of the whole conversation was only to just be like every like as a group as suitemates we should all contribute to the room responsibilities,0.907
920.8,921.5, mmm,0.713
928.2,929.1, I think,0.749
931.8,961.4, there's a time when in high school where I was working on a project and I had I love being with friends but sometimes working with friends isn't always the easiest for me because sometimes I have a hard time confronting people if things aren't obviously being done the right way and so I there was an issue within the project and I didn't a second front my friend and the,0.738
961.8,980.5, manner I think it was like an immature way of doing it and she was a little hurt and obviously thinking about it now I think it might have come off a in the wrong way and like slightly too aggressive and so I think,0.894
982.5,1012.1, now I would say I'm really good about thinking things through I would say now at least before I approach anything but at least in high school there were times where I would obviously get frustrated with when things weren't going accordingly because I always wanted everything to be perfect but that's just an idea that I've kind of let go of in terms of like being a perfectionist like obviously doing my best to make it perfect but not making it like to the point where I'm like OCD about being,0.806
1012.3,1037.8, factionist and so I think looking back on that situation now I wouldn't have acted the way I did about a small project unlike like kind of caught my friend for something I would rather kind of like sit her down and just be honest with her and not it just should have been if I guess if as it was,0.91
1049.3,1078.8, sometimes I feel guilty about not being able to see my family as much as I would like to or even sometimes calling like I try my best to call every day but sometimes I know I get a little sidetracked / lazy about it and I love him a lot and I just sometimes feel really bad when I just kind of like sometimes sometimes choose,0.82
1079,1080.5, not to call because I'm like,0.824
1081.7,1096, just not even I don't have an excuse not to sometimes but like I just it's just me being me sometimes where I'm like I have a lot going on but I know I could squeeze in 5 minutes for a cone phone call but I just chose not to and obviously I don't see him often so like,0.858
1097.2,1119.9, it sometimes that is something that I feel really guilty about but then obviously when I do go home I try my best to spend as much time as I can with them but there have been times in the past where also when I don't see my friends too often I tend to spend sometimes a little more time than I necessarily shared with them when I'm on these brakes,0.906
1121.5,1145.4, and so I think being able to balance my time with my family and my friends when I'm home is something that I'm just like I'm continually continually learning to do and try to get better at dividing it might I'm equally but also like more so with my family because you know they're the people who are always there for me,0.825
1154.7,1179.5, I ever had to make was honestly whether or not to go abroad my first semester of college because first of all I never been home,0.728
1180.4,1192.4, away from home for more than like a month month and a half and like obviously the first semester itself is like three to four months and so first of all to go out of,0.871
1193.7,1223, out of the country for college my first semesters already intimidating and on top of that I never been away from home for so long and it's a whole new cultural immersion in a new country and so I think all of those factors combined were daunting but the same time they were exciting but it was one of those things that I had to decide for myself I want it or not,0.761
1223.5,1253.3, and I had other choices so I didn't have to go abroad my first semester but it was basically deciding between going abroad or going to a local University for my first semester I'm being close to home but I started did end up deciding to go abroad but it's not something I regret at all it's probably one of the best experiences of my life so I'm glad I was able to do it but it was definitely pretty difficult in the beginning too,0.826
1253.4,1261.6, decide if I wanted to go or not leaving my family behind and spending my first semester of college and a whole new country,0.81
1297,1300.2, terms of regrets hmm,0.844
1306.4,1331.8, I'm saying I don't know I know I have had regrets but like nothing is like coming to mind at the moment where I mean like in terms of regrets like I don't think I've had any like lifelong regrets or anything like too big where it's like stuck with me for like for so long I'm sure there's been times where,0.886
1332.6,1348.7, I wish I had done something differently but like I wouldn't call it a regret they've just been like small things I wish I had done differently but like I feel like we're grades a big word I don't think I've really necessarily regretted anything,0.883
1351,1354.5, to such an extent where I liked still remember it,0.838
1355.7,1360.4, so I would say at the moment I don't I can only think of her cry right now,0.776
1369.4,1392.4, I have not served in the military but I have a lot of a lot of respect for people who do pursue to do that I think it's amazing being able to you know like protect your country and I think it's a big it's a big step and it is daunting and I think it's really inspirational to see those people be able to do that,0.831
1399.6,1401.4, I have not joined the military,0.804
1409.3,1411.8, I've actually never enlisted in the military,0.79
1419.5,1424.6, it was never something that I was necessarily considering so,0.873
1426.8,1432.9, it's not something I think about often and I don't I don't know if it's something that's for me so,0.843
1434.2,1449.8, I wouldn't really say if I'm a cop you're happier I'm not if I'm happy or not but like it's just never been something I've considered doing so you know I've no qualms about like about not doing it,0.895
1460.9,1462, I have not,0.859
1477.5,1488.2, I have actually never seen like combat in person so I never had to deal with going back to seeing civilian life or anything like that,0.829
1502,1517.2, so I've actually never been part of the military so I've never had to worry about doing something afterwards at least right now as of right now it's not something I am considering pursuing either in the future,0.904
1539,1566.9, serving I haven't served in the military so I can't really assess you know really a test to what my experiences like but I do know a lot of people who have served in the military and I think it's very brave and commendable for those people to do that I feel like I for one know that something that I couldn't do so I really applaud the people that are able to do that and protect our country,0.797
1567.9,1570.3, I think it takes a lot of guts and a lot of,0.829
1572.3,1577.7, just like determination to be able to take on something as big as that,0.878
1588.5,1617.8, I've been feeling all right lately I guess it's like the busiest time of the school year right now because midterm season so I've have been feeling stressed and not getting as much sleep as I should or being good about eating on time and sleeping on time but like overall I've been my friends keep me going obviously since they're kind of like my family here in college so seeing them always helps me,0.863
1619.4,1637.5, feel a lot better before I have to get back to studying so like this past week was pretty stressful but the same time having my friends and other people I know who you know like boost morale always helps,0.749
1648.1,1668.9, in terms of behavior I feel like I obviously get a lot more tired easily but I think a lot of that has to do with not getting enough sleep because they're just staying up and doing work or other things that I need to complete and like because I am tired sometimes I get I get,0.829
1671.3,1700.9, like my my energy is lower so like I'm not sick as excited about some things sometimes I wish I could be but I'm just like so tired that like I just don't have the energy to be as excited but I think all of those things that can be changed and a lot of it just stems down to like you know like living a healthy lifestyle and sleeping on time as best as much as I can even though,0.817
1701.2,1703.1, it's hard to hang Square,0.772
1714.5,1744, honestly it's not that easy getting a good night's sleep because for one one thing that's on me for sure is my procrastination it's something that I have like continue to do no matter what it's just really hard for me to start things early and get them out of the way so I feel like a lot of part a lot a large part of it has to do with perhaps the nation but it also has to do with me being busy with other things as well and also focusing on things outside,0.772
1744.2,1768.2, school so I feel like a sleeping earlier is possible if I don't procrastinate but it's also just something that I really haven't been able to get myself to do so like I feel like it's more so my fault for not being able to get enough sleep more than anything else,0.88
1775.4,1799.7, when I don't sleep well I just feel very like low on energy super tired so like you know all I'm thinking about is wanting to take a nap or get some rest I really don't feel like seeing anyone not I'm not an also on top of that like sometimes I don't really want to see other people and this is all usually when I'm like super super tired,0.831
1802.2,1820.4, and that's over pulling all-nighters you did those are like the things that happen why like when I pull an all-nighter if I just get less sleep in general then like it's not as bad I just you know I am tired and like because of that then like I do feel like I have less energy and more to contribute to,0.752
1822.2,1837.4, or less to contribute to in terms of whatever I'm working on we're dealing with I think because there's a lack of many things it's just overall my character and like,0.913
1839.7,1862.7, the way I act just doesn't match up to like how I am when I do get a good night's sleep I feel like when I'm tired I just you know want to go back to my room now and I really want to talk to anyone like I obviously will if I do see people but like in my mind I'm just thinking like I don't want to be here right now when I'm tired,0.909
1872.5,1899.8, I do think therapy's very useful I've never been to a therapist but I know friends who have and I hear about their experiences and I think it's very crucial especially when you feel like you are dealing with something where you just need someone to talk to and like your friends and you might have friends and family there for you and I think that in itself is that there is kind of like therapeutic but I also think having a,0.776
1900,1929.8, just really helpful and I don't understand why people sometimes attached like a stigma to like seeing a therapist and and saying it's bad and like not worth it because in my mind I think it can be very beneficial as long as you're also willing to be open to sharing your experiences I think it overall is a good way to help one be able,0.896
1929.9,1934.4, to deal with your emotions and just have someone to talk it out with,0.896
1943,1943.9, advice would you give,0.634
1950.5,1964.3, I'm 20 years old now I would say 10 years ago when I was 10 the advice I would have given myself would be to honestly just enjoy life I feel like,0.751
1966.1,1978.5, in like middle school and high school I got really stressed with school and about getting into college and like I feel like in some ways I deviated from having a fun time,0.821
1980,1983.8, and so I think also just hiding myself that like,0.733
1986.7,1987.2, that,0.704
1988.4,2017.1, that everything will everything will work out one way or another and not to like stress so much about school like also just enjoy growing up because I was the times where you can't get back and just enjoy your time with your friends cuz you know you never know if you're going to be the one to move away from home and go to a different college so I think just taking it all in having a good time obviously do well in school but also maybe like,0.798
2018.3,2039.2, I don't know take a step back sometimes from school and also have a good time like I definitely still had a great time in high school but I definitely think and middle school but I think thinking now I feel like I could have I could have maybe should have also taken a step back and just enjoy it a little more than I actually did,0.907
2052.6,2076.6, um possum I felt really happy with actually pretty recently when I went to my trip to Nicaragua just being able to help the community just made me really happy and like seeing their smiles and their positive energy you know throughout the week just made my day and I don't just being able to leave a social impact as always been my goal in life,0.893
2079,2108.6, and doing something as small as going to Nicaragua and like helping this community with their Community with their goals meant a lot I was able to learn a lot from the community itself about the people about the culture and it's just a very rewarding and memorable experience in my life and those probably like I was on a huge high of like being happy at that that whole week because I knew I was doing something,0.852
2108.8,2115.7, loved and enjoyed so yeah that's why we're the most recent time I've been super super happy,0.885
2128.8,2131.2, I would definitely say my parents have been,0.851
2133.3,2162.9, a huge positive influence in my life they've always you know guided me and supported me and everything that I've done I've you know switched like career interest like multiple times but they've always been there you know they've never pressured me to do anything we've always been open to me kind of do whatever I want to pursue you know they're always just there for me when I'm having a bad day just need like some,0.883
2163.1,2191.6, poor or advice I know I can come whenever and like you know they'll pick up and it's just been inspirational because you know they're immigrants and they emigrated to the to the us so that my brother and I could have a better life here obviously and seeing them able to you know start off with a small business and grow it to being a very successful business,0.767
2193,2216.9, just makes me so happy and just so motivated to do the same thing and be able to make them proud so yeah I feel like they've done so much my brother and I and I just hope that you know we can at least do as much as we can to make them proud and know that like everything we're so appreciative of everything they've done for us and life,0.912
2221,2250.7, I think my best friends would describe me as someone who just loves being there for you know all the people in her life and someone who enjoys exploring new things new cities and just having a fun time with people she loves and all see also,0.762
2250.8,2259.9, being able to get to know other people as well I feel your pain I just care if they would probably describe me as someone,0.897
2262.6,2273.2, so that's what I always sent a gap but I feel like it pretty much describes me than that she'll,0.849
2284.6,2286.1, so,0.913
2287.7,2314.5, I see since spring break was so recent the thing that has made me like the happiest and something I've enjoyed so much was my Nicaragua trip over spring break and being able to go there and help you know the these people in the community really grow their businesses because it's something that I've been learning to do in my classes and like being able to really apply those skills,0.862
2316.9,2343.6, you know in the real world and have more of a Hands-On approach was very cool and rewarding to know what I'm learning is also being is also a thing that can be applied in the real world so it's one of those things I really enjoyed not only because I was able to use my business skills that I learned in college and in my classes but like I was also able to meet like you know so many wonderful people and like,0.78
2344.5,2357.7, they were super sweet and encouraging and being able to hear everyone's stories was just amazing I just know this trip is something that I will always carry throughout my life,0.723
2374.4,2377.5, I am most proud of,0.82
2383.5,2385, I would say as of right now,0.734
2386.9,2407.3, being able to be here at USC I feel very blessed to be here and have the opportunity to go to such a grade school and my parents have made so many sacrifices for my brother and I so being able to being able to be here and make them proud honestly just makes me feel proud,0.904
2410,2439.3, and you know I worked really hard and high school and I just know that the reason I'm here is because of my worth ethic and you know all the hard work that I put in behind behind behind all my work and I'm really just you know balancing out my school and extracurriculars I think and doing well in school I think really helped me too,0.91
2439.5,2459.5, well and also like be able to get into UIC I think it's it was always like the Top Choice in mind to being able to get into the school that I loved was amazing and it just really made me feel proud I feel like as of right now just being here is something that I feel very proud of and honestly also very blessed to be here,0.735
2465.8,2474.6, thank you I had a great time being able to just have a simple conversation those super light-hearted and just getting to know me so thank you,0.821
