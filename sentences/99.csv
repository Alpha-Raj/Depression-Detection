138.5,167.2, I would say when I was in high school and I was playing on an orchestra tour and after like we had this beautiful concert outside and then afterwards a few of us stuck around and started playing just for fun and like the was like the venue is at the top of a hill I'd like some historic place is gorgeous and then afterwards he stuck around I just played at the entrance way of the venue and people still stuck around just to watch us play,0.814
176.9,178.8, my favorite subject,0.827
180.7,182.7, was probably,0.75
184.5,186.6, English or history,0.826

233,234.3, do you want more from me,0.813
235.4,237.7, does the program want a longer answer,0.913
246.8,253.7, if I could do anything and be good at it probably art and also like make,0.881
255.1,263.6, a sustainable like income but I love what I want to do I wouldn't do it otherwise,0.885
267.9,274.4,I'm solidly in the middle,0.797
277.7,292.6, honestly depends seasonally but I understand that it's important for people to feel that they are comfortable in group settings and I want them to feel comfortable around me so I make an active effort to be outgoing,0.836
299.2,313.8, I because it's personally I don't like the feeling of feeling like clicked out and you know everyone's here for a good time if I can make other people feel more comfortable why not and you can make cool friends as you go,0.778
321.2,340.1, it is not cool I have a good time I have my mother who we are free we are very friendly and kind of almost like a friend relationship kind of we argued a lot when I was in high school which is probably why we get along now,0.771
343.1,344.4, my father does exist,0.836
346,353.3, that's a little cruel and there's the possibility that this could be shown out so I'm going to rephrase all of that,0.878
356.1,359.6, my mother and I get along my father is,0.844
361.1,374, a good dad he fits into the stereotypical role of like you know I work he liked the breadwinner excetera we have issues I will bury them deep down inside and do with them,0.838
375.5,381.1, just kidding I'm dealing with them now I am an adult and I have a little brother we kind of get along we argue also plans to,0.802
382.7,383.8, this is terrible,0.801
395.1,417.7, I play music I talk to my friends I go on long walks I plan excursions for myself and I really try to cultivate a lifestyle in which it's not necessary to do superficial things to escape that lifestyle but at the same time I really value the time I have with myself,0.849
419,419.8, for myself,0.826
428.2,439.1, I'm pretty good or I think that's a weird statement because I feel like the way that we are socialized or the way that I've been socialized I am not,0.903
440.7,442.8, like mmm,0.815
443.9,444.7, for and,0.864
446,454.9, yeah for I'm pretty good at it I don't get aggressively angry at people I do Harbor resentment sometimes instead,0.867
458.3,465.2, I say just say just talk to people about things,0.751
466.5,468.2, because you can just communicate,0.852
478.7,479.7, yesterday,0.832
480.9,496.6, I argued with a colleague and perhaps a friend of mine about the role of got well as about same-sex marriage he says thoughts,0.85
499.6,502.8, I think he believes heavily implied,0.831
504.2,520.1, basically said outright that same-sex attraction is an anomaly and therefore abnormal and therefore should be considered almost an Abomination because it's not what the majority wants,0.871
522.6,530.8, we had not so much a full-blown argument but we very clearly expressed that our views were very different had a good time,0.899
545,562.8, yeah yesterday I feel like a in an effort to be cordial and to maintain my working relationship with him I agreed a little too much or not agreed but I should have actively address some of the things he said and,0.851
565,586.5, I at the same time it wasn't a forum appropriate for detailed conversation I do regret that but not that much if you want like a big regret in high school I used to talk back to my Orchestra conductor who is kind of racist but it's cool I got in trouble for it none of the,0.8
588.8,593, a lot of other people to not get in trouble for things that I did,0.882
596.4,598.7, and that's just how life is,0.862
600.9,605.2, C'est La Vie having a good time we need incision,0.892
624.4,636.1, I guess I feel guilty there's not very many things I feel guilty about I try my hardest to live my life in a way in which I can at least have the knowledge that,0.885
637.3,661.7, everyone's like you assume the best intentions of everyone you provide a space for them to speak and you are at the least friendly and responsive I am guilty about not knowing those lessons earlier and my interactions with for example my mother in high school,0.863
664.6,666.8, hindsight is 20/20 though so,0.867
668.2,678.1, not too much like crippling guilt as in like but more so like guilt as in like these are things that I can learn from and move forward in,0.892
692.3,695.6, don't want to do that because I don't,0.731
697.5,699.2, yeah let's see,0.844
704.8,710.4, thank you for that non-committal noise I think the hardest decision I made,0.893
711.8,714.8, was probably just a sighting that I wanted to change,0.819
716.4,735.4, my this is very general but it's a decision that's been playing on continually and its decision that I choose to continue every day so I think it still counts as a singular decision I'd say like I made a decision when I was really depressed I was like this isn't what I want to do anymore,0.895
737.6,740.6, so I made the decision to,0.895
742.4,744.3, live in ways that I would,0.845
745.4,752, you can't just like quote-unquote fix my brain by just deciding I want to but there are a lot of choices,0.783
753.3,758.5, that I can make every day to ensure like you know I suffer if you don't have to,0.751
759.5,772.8, and why not alleviate suffering if you can and why not be radically kind Etc instead of just deeply and bettered know I'm still working on that,0.851
776.8,785.5, I feel like that's that it was this question asked yeah wait wasn't this question,0.903
787.6,788.5, I regret,0.703
791.7,804.7, I don't really regret a lot of things oh my God I don't really regret a lot of things because you can just learn for like everything is a learning experience and of itself tell you about what of it,0.912
815.9,823, I don't have any of those I want to keep all my memories I'm coming off really hostile but I'm just distinctly uncomfortable,0.879
828.2,828.6, cool,0.902
834.4,835.1, no,0.804
842.8,846.4,feeling lately last week was rough,0.881
851.8,858.1, this week last last week was rough I was really sick I was on my period,0.898
860.9,874, had a lot of work I had to pick up a lot of well I didn't have to I volunteered for a little too much of other people's responsibilities,0.904
877.2,894.7, but it's done and I did what I thought to do I sat down journaled oh back to the relaxing questions I Journal I sat down I journaled about it figured out what I wanted to do and I'm going to do it so don't utter this week having a good time,0.813
903.6,911.5, nothing drastic it's always been this is like a so therapy session is that what it is,0.909
914.4,924.2, but I'd say in regards or if I'm pretending I'm in therapy no nothing of notes I've been,0.892
925.9,946.1, kind of stressed out about how I just I forgot I had like a major concert event last week to yeah it's I've been noticing that I've been more scattered in the past three weeks up until last week than I had been,0.829
947.3,977, formally but this like this past week the reason why I lost it was also so rough was because I had to take a lot of time out of my day to day activities to really sit down and focus on like what I was doing that was changing my behavior what was causing me to be more overworked what was causing me to be a little resentful that other people aren't doing work or at that I felt that other people weren't fulfilling their job responsibilities and,0.873
977.1,1005.7, notice I caught that I was being resentful so I spoke to other people on the board kind of to gauge like how much am I just internalizing this how much am I like you know like you know emotions are inherently valid but was I right in saying that I was taking on too much work or am I just like missing something is something going on in other people's lives that I should know that I can accommodate for instead and to be more understanding,0.841
1008.6,1038.2, it's so to recap and to make this simpler my behavior had been changing for about two weeks but it wasn't something I think necessarily tied to like my history of like my history of why I went to therapy which was like generally like extreme depression a lot of anxiety I recognized that my anxiety has been picking up lately but I've also in response to that kind of set up like check,0.833
1038.3,1060.1, - for me breaks for me and accommodated my schedule for that so sorry again to make the long story short yes my mood has changed but within the past week and actually for the last two weeks I'd say I've made really concrete steps to acknowledge that change and so in that regard no I still have the same,0.871
1061.4,1065.7, belief that I can manage,0.903
1079.2,1104.8, not very easy because my roommate sets alarms from 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. and she wakes up at 10 or maybe 9:00 a.m. I don't know because I'm really tired but I just talked to her and I was like please can we have quiet hours from 2 to 7 a.m. and that worked out that made things a lot better because I go to bed around,0.808
1105.9,1134.6, and I wake up around 9 a.m. which is a good seven hours in an Ideal World at least however I do end up playing games on my phone from two to three something that I was changed in my sleep schedule is I used to take long walks last semester right before I went to sleep so around like 12 or 11 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. I would start going on a walk around campus,0.802
1136.7,1157.8, so relatively safe in the scheme of things there's security Etc no one else is also there the scariest thing they're like very large possums that are not scared of humans the small ones are cute so I think like that change in my routine has altered my sleep schedule,0.908
1159.3,1177.8, but also like just my workload I just go to sleep later I don't know why I like I said my I have noticed that my moods change and I think just the up taking anxiety in the last like three weeks four weeks I can't count what day is it and also like,0.85
1178.8,1202, combined with you know a lot of work that I've had to do has made me less efficient like I can no longer I used to like you know sit down for a solid three our chunk and I'd be like I will study for 20 minutes I'll take a 5 minute break I will study for 20 minutes I'll take a five-minute break so like Pomodoro except I don't align with the time methods that don't know why,0.814
1203.3,1217.3, yeah but now it takes you know I take a little too long to do the work how except in the last week again like I've mentioned I feel like I'm getting like back on my bullshit pardon my French but,0.897
1218.9,1219.5, like,0.895
1220.7,1231.7, so like in the past few days at least I've been going back to bed at like two before like one to two and waking up around night cool,0.825
1237.4,1267.1, I'm crabby I don't do it because in high school I didn't sleep enough I was sleeping like three hours a night at most and sometimes like three all-nighters in a row I passed out Miss sentence but it was cool it's not not cute to like trivialize that that sucked but I learned never to do that again I think and I noticed another people too which is why I'm really sorry,0.911
1267.3,1297, pathetic to them like to people when they're not like extremely cordial or like extremely friendly is that you know like you get crabby and it's like you have good intentions and or at least I keep saying you I have good intentions but or and in other people that I see like everyone has good at Great intentions and they just like doing have the filter to say it tactfully necessarily but you know it's,0.87
1297.2,1315, it's not the end of the world like most times people like my friends was very sleep-deprived like I can tell she's very well-intentioned and she's like she's not like being mean or bitchy she just is so sleep-deprived I had a point I lost it,0.883
1321.3,1349, I'm going to take that non-committal aha to continue now I can't continue on that so that's basically it I get crabby when I don't sleep enough and I don't do enough like I don't know it takes me like twice as long to do the same activity and then I like mini nap which doesn't help at all I'd just rather go to bed at night I've gotten old I can't pull all-nighters no not that I should have been pulling should have been pulling them,0.816
1361,1388.2, yes I do yeah this is a yes or no question but to elaborate yes also partially I feel like the reason why I'm not being super friendly with you Ellie is because in the past I went to therapy was a really nice face for me I have to work really hard to be like social and friendly,0.913
1388.4,1418.2, and I don't mind doing that because I love getting to know people I love getting to know what they're passionate about I love you know seeing people thrive and that's what I love about therapy at the same time like it's kind of very tiring to be in a lot of leadership positions and always be like to always be very intentional of your mannerisms you're like movements like if I were talking to someone in real life,0.787
1418.3,1433.1, and this wasn't a computer movement and by real-life I also mean outside of therapy like I my therapist office when I used to go to therapy artists it like this but if I'm in a real car you you can't see but I'm assuming if you want to look at the recordings you can,0.791
1436,1464.6, but you know every other in every single other aspect of my life I am so conscious and very intentional in how I sit how I speak my intonation my fluctuation what I'm doing with my face and it's because honestly to be quite Frank I don't have the privilege where I can sit like some like white author on the back of a textbook or not textbook like you know those like terrible novels you pick up and they say,0.893
1464.7,1476.3, it like broodingly on the chair like if I do that like over the seems so rude and detached and like pretentious you know I'm like I don't think,0.765
1477.6,1506.6, I couldn't quote unquote pool off like sitting like that cool Professor who comes not Professor I mean like in high school this is such a tangent a lie I mean like in high school when you had those like like teachers who would come in and be like no textbooks fuck the system and then they would sit with like their arms over the back of the chair and they would sit on the chair backwards to really show it liked everyone can't do that I can't get away with that I just seem like a try yeah,0.832
1507.8,1525.3, I don't think I can get away with you would I think people would subconsciously be very uncomfortable not like like willingly and not harmfully but they would be so uncomfortable with this tiny Asian girl doing that and like a pairing bossy,0.852
1527.4,1534, yeah and I think just because of my youth they would write me off as idealistic and arrogance,0.895
1535.2,1540.5, what was this question therapy is useful yes yes it is I do believe in it,0.894
1548.8,1566.4, um you know what this we live in a we live in tumultuous times relatively I know that's not you know maybe like we have like it's not like the stone age's when we're trying to like kill each other to survive that's a gross exaggeration I know my history that's not really,0.894
1568.5,1598.2, but I think what the prevalence of media really emphasizing like and sensationalizing some like polarizing terrible things I think also with us you know with like the pressure that a lot of young people face that like we have to take action now like are things are happening like you know and also like being in Los Angeles like or not so I not being in Los Angeles but just an example like of like for example my son,0.862
1598.4,1609, in Los Angeles you know I have friends and peers who are concerned about like ice and being here as an undocumented,0.888
1610.5,1639.6, person I friends who you know had to take a break from social media after seeing you know their friends houses were being burned down in the vires I have friends who are going you know and you know like I'm assuming like if that's happening in my sphere it's happening in like everyone you know walk down the street everyone's going through something and we can we should all it would be amazing if we could all seek to Foster,0.783
1640.3,1659.6, environment is society in which we understand that people need accommodations we understand that we are compassionate we are actively you know actively responsive actively compassionate and also at the same time are incredibly compassionate to ourselves but that's not what we live in and I think,0.913
1660.7,1687.9, that's just a sight I that's why I think like so many people need therapy but also specifically for mental illnesses for specifics like extenuating circumstances therapy is fantastic to help you know it's like going to the doctor you have to go to the doctor if you like taking care of yourself is pretty critical,0.764
1688.8,1700.3, that's why I think therapy is important those are very roundabout way but I think there are a lot of ways to answer this question and I have maybe like 20 minutes top I don't want to pull out my phone but yeah,0.824
1708.7,1734.8, I am 19 so I 20 years ago I'd have been like good luck my dude sorry uh-huh ten years ago when I was 9 years I would have given myself any advice at nine years old I'm nine I don't know anything I'm learning about supernovas and thinking they're the coolest thing on earth I would be like cool like keep doing that but at the snow,0.801
1735.1,1764.8, that what I wanted I wouldn't necessarily give her advice but I would go back and be like you know I wish you would like something that I wish I learned earlier is that like you know the community I really grew up in really emphasized like worth being dependent on something and I wish I could go back and be like and everyone's worth is inherent and intrinsic I wouldn't have known what inherent and intrinsic was like is 9 years old and I could barely read English,0.891
1764.9,1794.8, wish I could read English but I was just 9 year olds don't have a very good grasp on grammar maybe but like you know just in general going into the past I would be like be compassionate to yourself don't take things to understand how to acknowledge your emotions and then try and maybe move on for them I'd also be like stop going to church they're really homophobic and racist now this program,0.747
1795,1805.1, / oh it's 12:35 what moved in this program that made the Bottom bar pop up was it always there no I'm what is how,0.776
1808.7,1823.7, sorry sorry note it says activate Windows now I was just distracted by the little speech bubble in the corner but I will refocus I would say you know going back to my 9 year old self or ten-year-old I would say if I could pick a pick like 14 15,0.74
1825.1,1826.3, go to therapy,0.809
1827.4,1829.6, things are hard but it's really worth it,0.872
1830.7,1835.6, worth is inherent these are an advice like oh um,0.816
1837.3,1840.9, don't take classes you don't care about question mark but I mean,0.855
1842.6,1844.7, I hesitate to give advice,0.838
1846.3,1851.1, I know that it was really really hard for me sometimes,0.837
1852.5,1882.1, but even now I can't say I would go back and change anything because what I learned made me who I am and I'm so so grateful to my past self or you know to who I was when I was younger for getting me this far I do wish that she didn't have to work so hard or suffer so much but I you know it's like the Marty I've never watched Back to the Future but it's like you don't want to like ruin like you don't want to,0.827
1883.1,1895.3, do something tweaked something in the past that like changes to your also don't think my past self would listen this was truly experience taught like the world taught me a lesson that I should listen to advice,0.825
1898.1,1900, yeah I would say,0.811
1902.8,1921.1, but maybe perhaps I just need more compassion towards myself because if I think about like just youth in general and nine years old and ten-year-olds on 10 year olds in general I would be like yeah like here's some advice take notes but for some reason when I think about my past self I'm like you needed to learn this lesson,0.81
1922.8,1938.8, which isn't really a philosophy I hold I think that if you can less learn lessons in the less painful way you know go for it an advice is good you can learn from advice without necessarily yeah okay so I guess I would give myself solid advice,0.909
1940.9,1944, this is so hypothetical I don't know I'm thinking so much about it,0.891
1945.2,1957.8, but it boils down to I'm incredibly grateful like not grateful but I do acknowledge that my like experience okay cool cool cool cool cool by do I open the door,0.878
1976.4,1979.5, and you're going to go right back out where you were when was the last time,0.885
