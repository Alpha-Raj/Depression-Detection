347.4,376.7, most memorable experiences I I once gave a presentation about some research that I had done over my senior year of high school to essentially my entire high school student body and I received really positive feedback afterwards and it was part of my motivation for my major which is psychology and my minor which is consumer Behavior,0.79
390.8,413.9, for a long time actually really didn't like school I think I really enjoyed physics the way I only took that one year possibly even just one semester but that made me feel really connected to my family my brother studied physics and then my dad with his aerospace engineering background alumni of USC,0.908

505.6,513.4, I think that's a hard question for me because I thank my dreams for myself have always been,0.767
514.7,537.8, very dichotomous I either saw myself as like taking a path like my mother which is actually that she doesn't work she's a full-time Homemaker and caretaker and that would allow me certain freedoms like you know exploring travel or philanthropy or just motherhood,0.886
540.8,551.4, and I thought like what I would do would be to get my PhD so that I could be a professor and then,0.891
552.6,582.3, like either take a few years off work when I had kids and then start again or and like hopefully have done some research at some point in time before after during any of that and now I think my dream job has evolved into something that's either more so like working with kids or just something that I think,0.903

768.7,790.7, focusing on my breathing pausing and recognizing my body language and making sure like that I'm not you know doing something that will subconsciously make me like more anxious or closed off to other people and then I think I also,0.859
792.1,818.2, just take some time for myself if I feel like overwhelmed and I'll relax by going and being in my room and I can feel over stimulated sometimes by like music or too much noise so usually I'll either do this in silence or I will engage in some low energy activity like reading or something online,0.893
831,831.9, very mixed,0.707
835.2,856.1, mixed results I am sometimes quite good at it I'm usually though I will be somewhat explosive at first and then my like recovery is what's really strong my communication and reflection on what happened and my ability to read and control once I feel like I've expressed myself,0.906

958.9,988.4, I feel guilty about my wastefulness I feel very guilty about my level of materialism I think it's something that especially being at USC has both been put under the spotlight and thereby in some ways worsened in other ways bettered I can sometimes the come to,0.905
988.7,1009.2, like I need to shop or dress a certain way to have like a high self-esteem or positive self image and then as I'm grounded by my boyfriend and I recall like that those aren't the values that I actually want to project as being my values and that those aren't the things that will,0.788
1010.7,1023.4, like in the end bring me like actual happiness and like long-term happiness then I am kind of like oops I did that again I need to work on that,0.855
