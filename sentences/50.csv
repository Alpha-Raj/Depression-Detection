115.9,129.6, I like that with traveling you get to experience a lot of new things new Lifestyles new places you get to see places you've never seen before so very freeing,0.877
136.9,151.5, um one of my most memorable trips was one where I studied abroad in London that was great because I was all alone rather than with family or with people that I know so I got to meet new people and kind of explore outside my comfort zone,0.843
162.7,179.7, I think my most memorable experience was just the fact that I was all alone in this huge City that I've never been to before going out with my friends meeting new people and then traveling within the study abroad was even a bigger experience,0.845
188.7,198, my favorite subject would have to be although I didn't really have one I would choose English,0.853
205.2,217.1, I'm a student and I am studying creative writing and I did you work part-time but I'm no longer working part-time because of school,0.874
229.4,242.9, if I could do something else if I could do something else I think that my dream job would be maybe owning my own successful Bakery,0.91
252.3,271.5, although I do consider myself very outgoing because I do like to try a lot of new things and experiences I'm not afraid I do sometimes in those situations act a little shy or and a little bit more reserved but that doesn't change the fact that I am very outgoing I just kind of have to adapt to my situation,0.845
278.9,302.5, I don't know I think that a lot of the questions that I've been asked in the surveys answer it for the most part I think that sometimes you know in a situation I've never been in before which comes along with being outgoing I do kind of have doubts or second guesses about myself but once I'm really into what I've chosen to do I think I become a little bit more comfortable,0.806
311.3,329, for the most part I have a very good relationship with my family although my parents are divorced I'm very very close to my mom and her stepdad I don't often times keep good contact with my dad but we're still in contact with each other,0.901
336.9,344.8, hmm to relax think my idea of relaxing is just going home and partaking in my routine,0.801
346.6,351.1, of just like going on my computer watching videos and relaxing,0.792
359.4,375, um I've become better at controlling my temper but it has definitely been a work in progress and a struggle sometimes I do lose track of that control but I do try to just get right back on to it,0.899
384.3,401.2, the last time I argued with someone was let's see I can't even remember but probably with my mom because we do a lot of stilling arguing but it was about the dishes,0.85
415.4,435.7, I can't think of a specific situation but with most situations I do tend to very quick to react without really like thinking about my reaction so in most situations I do regret the way I handled myself and I wish that I could have gone back and kind of,0.906
436.8,440.5, thought through my actions before going through with them,0.878
452.6,468.7, one day thing I feel guilty about always is the way I tend to speak to my immediate family especially with my mom and my stepdad it seems a bit easier to lash out or be rude but,0.865
470.3,481.7, I just wish I could handle myself a little better with them is just discomfort level that I have that allows me to act the way I do which isn't right but that's something I feel guilty about,0.782
502,504.9, the hardest decision I've ever had to make,0.913
511.5,514.5, I can't think of one that's a hard question,0.864
519.2,519.8, I think,0.738
522.4,524.3, one that pops to my mind is,0.839
525.9,535.8, a decision of going outside my comfort realm for instance when one example would be when choosing to want to go study abroad it was a very hard decision,0.902
537.3,566.8, on whether or not I was ready to leave my life in La behind because I had this fear of missing out which is pretty prominent in my life so that decision to kind of be independent that also ties along with the decision of coming out of a three-year relationship that I was obviously not happy in but it was very hard because I never wanted to be alone same with my trip to London it was that idea of being alone rather than in the,0.89
567,583.5, comfort of my normal lifestyle so I think that's a pretty hard decision of just stepping outside my comfort zone and being independent rather than relying on a group of people or a certain person for a long period of time,0.817
593.2,619.4, something I regret I can't I've said that I regret a lot of the ways I acted when I was younger specifically in that three year relationship I regret not realizing my true self worth and like even with friendships not even in a relationship and past friendships that have failed or where I've let the,0.841
620.4,643.1, that person or group of people get the best of me I haven't really been able to understand my true self worth I don't regret it because I've learned now what my wantings are in my my self-worth is but I do regret that I didn't know this in the past and it took me this long to realize it,0.908
655.6,682.8, I think one of those would be from what I was much younger and when my parents were going through their divorce they were actually divorced at this time I was in my Dad's apartment with my two older brothers and something that I had said cause my dad to lash out at my older brother who was fighting with me and but my dad's lashing out,0.854
683.1,712.2, a bit extreme so it caused this whole scene where my brothers left the house and there was yelling and you know like cops came to the house and searched the house that's one thing I just want to erase from my memory because although I know this now and that moment from however old I was about seven or eight to have all of that happen over one in question that I had asked my brother,0.733
713,729.9, all because of that one statement I had made kind of made me think that this was all because of me so like to this day I do wish I could just erase that moment out of my head because it has stuck with me all these years but yeah just a bad experience but yeah,0.821
740,741.2, no I have not,0.863
752.2,763.2, I feel good just very stressed out because I'm coming to a close end with school and I'm still kind of debating on what I want to do or kind of have some doubts about my,0.838
765.6,789.1, about where my level of ability is at when it comes to my major in creative writing and my ability to do things that some of my my disability to do things that some of my other classmates can do better the kind of just draws me back a little bit and makes me a little nervous on my future and what I'm really going to do with my major,0.719
799.5,817.8, I've become a lot more harder on myself I feel a lot more nervous and I always have had this eagerness to know what I'm going to do in the future to know that I'm going to be secure but lately it's become a little bit more real in a sense that it's all happening so quickly so,0.854
819.3,831.6, just with this like almost overnight change I've been a bit more in my head about my success in the future and that thought process is really getting to me,0.913
840.9,851.9, for the most part unless I'm thrown off by a dream or something that is just weird I'm able to fall asleep pretty easily at night,0.829
854.4,860.9, it's just as I just it's a matter of fact on whether or not my mind is clearer or not,0.766
864.6,888.2, the only instance where I've had bad sleep for periods of time is due to a specific dreamer movie that I watched that kind of causes me to be uneasy but other than that I've never had a problem with sleeping at night it's says whatever time I choose to sleep I usually just I'm able to fall asleep,0.891
895.5,924.5, I'm very irritable that's for sure if I don't sleep well yeah I if I sleep which sounds funny but like if I don't sleep enough I'm irritable if I sleep too much I'm irritable if I don't see it's just up this pattern of like being tired and feeling that you're just kind of like lazy and that's when I haven't slept or even when I've gotten too much sleep there isn't this feeling of refreshment it's,0.784
924.7,925.5, just like a,0.853
927.5,948.7, wanting to see more in a way because of this laziness I've gotten into but um that's a pattern even though it's easy for me to fall asleep at night that's a something I struggle with is how long I sleep either get too little sleep or too much sleep that's one big thing that I need to adjust as my sleeping patterns,0.814
961.7,990.4, I've been in and out of therapy since I was eight years old when my parents got a divorce and I do I think that it's helpful momentarily if that makes sense I I've always noticed a change in patterns at five consecutive I've been seeing a therapist for a good amount of time but as soon as and my head is clear my head is in the right place and that moment of time but I've found,0.8
990.6,992.4, and all these years that,0.748
993.7,1014.4, if the routine comes to a stop or if I'm turned off in a certain way by a talk that I had with my therapist or a situation it's just like this downward spiral it I mean it maybe it's because I haven't met the right person but I think that therapy has its helpful,0.836
1015.8,1031.7, but it also depends on the person and how they take that therapy I think that's like a really big thing because there's no harm in it I don't see any harm in it whatsoever I think it's about where your head is at and whether or not you're ready for that therapy,0.867
1047.2,1076.4, I think to not worry about how much I please other people that's something that I live with all throughout my childhood something my mom always told me I mean I heard it all the time to just not worry so much about other people pleasing them what they think if I could give myself that knowledge I feel like today I'd be less of an anxious person I wouldn't worry as much about the thoughts of other people and I just be more,0.913
1077,1100.7, and my actions it doesn't stop me from doing what I want to do at the end of the day but it is definitely a burden to constantly have that worry and I think only with not knowing that in the past 10 years if I had known that it wouldn't have gotten to the point where it's at now where I just have to learn now how to deal with it,0.732
1116.1,1117.2, maybe like,0.903
1120.3,1130.2, two weeks ago when I was at an event with my boyfriend that was a great moment for me,0.883
1141.1,1142.2, I think that,0.787
1144.8,1164.2, my I'm my mom has always been such a great positive person in my life she's she's been such a great influence because all throughout my life she's been that guidance that I've needed from both sides of my parents she definitely I never felt,0.843
1165.7,1170.4, worried going to her for any advice she's always pushed me to be my best,0.893
1174.4,1197.6, mmm my significant other currently is always pushing me to be my best to do what I do the best and to keep on doing things the best keeps me motivated with that said I think that even the negative people in my life have been a positive influence,0.728
1198.7,1200, because of,0.822
1202.3,1207.4, in a way what I'm trying to say is that even though they were a negative part of my life,0.838
1208.7,1212.7, they in that term influence me to be a better person,0.861
1214.2,1223.7, however they did it even if it was the wrong way I guess that hurt made me want to become more positive in a sense if that makes sense,0.893
1237.4,1237.8, yeah,0.788
