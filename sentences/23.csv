182.3,206.2, I enjoy the fact that you get to escape reality for a bit you got to go somewhere new really just immerse yourself in a new narrative you know your everyday to life like everyday life can get a little overwhelming and stressful so traveling is just a way for you to escape it and just do something new have fun going on adventures do things you've never done before and that's pretty appealing to me,0.896
214.7,243.5, okay so last summer I went to Tokyo I went to Tokyo because half of my family is Japanese I hadn't been there in like ten years so that was interesting total cultural shock people there are very very different from how we live here and that was both kind of amazing and also kind of like crazy I really enjoyed the food I want my family we,0.855

388.1,407.5, I'm in the middle I think I'm pretty introverted but I faked being extroverted very well like I can I can talk to people I don't get socially anxious or anything but I get tired from people really quickly so it's like a combination of both,0.909
414.2,441.8, um I don't know I guess because ideally I want to be like alone all the time no just kidding actually like spending time with people but just not that often so I don't know I guess I say that because I used to have a lot more friends in high school and then since coming to this school I've had like zero so now I don't really know how good I am at the relationship or friendship department so before if you would have asked I would have said outgoing but now I'm not exactly sure because I have no friends so,0.767
442,442.5, that,0.633
451.8,469.7, superficially it's a good one but underneath it they don't really know who I am and they're like super religious and super conservative so it's kind of hard for me to be myself around them they love me a lot they seem tight knit but I don't feel like we're tightening it like underneath the surface,0.846
478,493.3, I watch TV or I read or I sleep or I go out with friend,0.75

533,560.4, the last time I had a minor argument I mean it was last time I argued but it was a minor argument was with my roommate because I got mad at her because she watched a movie that's with someone else when she promised she would watch it with me so I got a little mad at her but it was very very minor argument if I were to say that argument before that that would be with my mom and that was because she didn't let me go to this study abroad program that I really wanted to go to,0.894
575.6,592.8, my last relationship to be honest it was toxic the person was toxic and everybody warned me that they were going to hurt me and then they did and I wish I could have gone back and just spared myself the Heartbreak,0.908
600.7,614.5, I'm not a good enough daughter because I'm always lying to my parents about who I am and what I'm doing and they do give me everything and I feel guilty about not trying harder to have a better relationship with them,0.735
628.6,629.9, the hardest decision,0.823
633.5,636.4, to be quite honest with you I really can't think of an answer to that question,0.888
646.8,648.1, I regret,0.72
653.1,682.5, I wish I could go back and spend more time building my passions and finding what I truly like instead of just doing things that you know like doing academics or like other academic related clubs because at the end of the day is how much as I want to be this like smart person I feel like I could Damia really just isn't for me and I spent the majority of my high school years focusing on that and focusing on getting into college,0.895

833.1,833.5, yeah,0.802
843.8,869.8, definitely I did therapy before I think it's a good like everyone needs a place where they could just talk about their selves because with friends it's like you feel like a burden and with family they don't always understand so having someone who's literally like paid and license to just listen to you and help you and you're not being a burden because you're paying them I think that's a great concept that everyone should invest in,0.909
874.1,874.6, okay,0.913
878.8,895.3, okay first off 20 years ago I wouldn't be alive so but ten years ago when I was nine well I really wish I'd be could be nine again but I would tell myself that,0.802
896.9,922.9, to invest in what to find out what I want to do to do what I want to do to work hard at it to like try new activities trying to sports focus on more than one thing just do everything because as a child you have so much potential and you're so carefree and you don't have no worries and I just wish I could tell my 9 year old self to really enjoy that and really take advantage of it because life gets harder a lot harder,0.89

1050.6,1068.9, and truly be able to understand my own behavior and actions you know emotional awareness is a double-edged sword like you don't always want to know so much about yourself but I feel like oftentimes people are ignorant to their own behavior and that only harms themselves,0.836
