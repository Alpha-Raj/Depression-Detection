113.5,139.6, sometimes especially like I USC's Camp as I don't always feel the safest I mean for the most part I think USC does a great job taking care of their students providing Yellowjackets providing free lift everything like that but other things that I don't like would probably be the traffic for sure the tropics a big one are there than that I love la I love big cities,0.795

205.4,206.3, world has to offer,0.857
215.4,243.8, okay so this past summer I went and lived in Shanghai for a month and a half just working traveling around and just really getting to know the culture of Shanghai which is totally different than other cities in China so I thought it was really a unique experience to be totally emerged and Shanghai and get to know the people the culture the food the streets the transportation all of that stuff,0.839
244.7,253.7, while being surrounded by people that I like trust completely so I didn't feel lonely ever so it was just a great experience,0.83
261.5,286.9, well traveling I would say when I got into like a cab and I guess I said the wrong address and then he took me to this rural place in Shanghai outside of the city and then I had to figure out how to get back so the cities that was just kind of crazy and like scary in the moment but looking back it's an awesome story and I learned a lot about how to communicate with people,0.764

342.6,363.3, something else maybe create a startup company if I were just like totally tech-driven and could code a bunch of stuff I would for sure try and get into that industry just because I think that that's where the future is headed and I think that that's a great opportunity just thrive business-wise,0.896
367.3,368.2, you can set yourself,0.725
372.3,393.2, I definitely consider myself an extrovert and I think everyone around me would classify myself as an extrovert but like most people I have moments of shyness where I get anxiety about going into very particular social situations but overall I think myself and everyone who knows me well would cost by myself as an outgoing person,0.825
400.8,427.8, I'll go in as even if I do have a little bit of anxiety going into a social situation I always push myself to just be the most friendly person and sociable person that I can be just because I know when I what I put out into the universe is what I get back and if I'm going to be friendly and nice people are going to be friendly nice and receptive back to me and that's how you make friendships relationships and honestly life is all about,0.701
428,429.6, people that you surround yourself with,0.857

548.4,549.3, one of my,0.719
554.1,578.3, oh common one is just like bar like sharing a car with my sister just like figuring out what day works for each of us but overall like it's a little like dispute we figure out who's thing like you really need the car for and it's typically just like a little spat so like last week just like getting the car back to her was like a little dispute but nothing major,0.787
592.8,620.7, maybe just one the little like I said before when little things start to build up and like I kind of reached my breaking point just to take a step back meditate on the situation and look at it from a much bigger perspective instead of feeling my emotions and acting on them in that particular moment being able to see that bigger picture and yeah just in that those few moments controlling my emotions better,0.889
633.1,662, maybe the way that I handle people that I don't like I kind of just shut them out of my life and protect not pretend they don't exist but I just like don't have a lot of patience for people that I feel are not benefiting me and I don't mean that in a selfish way I mean that in a like a mutually beneficial relationship where they provide like love and affection and you provide it right back and you're just like vibing with each other whereas like,0.834
662.2,683.7, people that I can see are clearly self-absorbed and just in their own world I don't really have the time or energy to deal with that too just like feed my energy into something we're just gonna like stay there and not be recycled box so I feel like I forget the question but I don't know hopefully got something from that,0.867
708.1,712.6, nothing really comes to mind right now so I guess I'm pretty blast,0.878

896.5,918.5, yeah definitely I think it's really productive to talk through your feelings and when you talk through them you get a much broader perspective on the situation that you're going through the feelings that you have and you can kind of look at it from a third-party view even though it is still happening to you and just gain some insight in that way and get some advice,0.819
931.3,949.2, 10 years ago I would have been 10 honestly I'm really proud of where I am today I'm proud of the person that I have been and continue to be so I would just say keep grinding keep your head down work hard play hard and keep doing what you're doing because it's all going to be okay,0.764
