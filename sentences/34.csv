634.6,653.1, depends on the day I think I get more sleep than most people most of my friends that I know but I do sometimes have trouble falling asleep and I tend to wake up early but that's just kind of like a biological clock thing having to get up early for classes so yeah,0.908

700.3,718.7, I just think it's helpful to talk to someone and sometimes it's nice to have a degree of removal so that they aren't in your everyday life they're not like one of your best friends but they're they're still to listen and maybe offer advice maybe not but sometimes just saying it helps you realize more about the situation,0.829
