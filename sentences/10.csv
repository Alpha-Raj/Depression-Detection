261.5,273.5, hmm I think it's mainly because for I guess to be shy in front of people I barely met it's mainly because I don't really know them and,0.746
274.6,284.5, I don't know I just don't know them and when I'm around my friends I guess they know me and have gotten to know me and it's just easier to be myself I guess,0.869

383.2,386.7, I guess I get into an argument but not that bad,0.789
394.5,399.3, the last time I argued with someone was during spring break,0.876
402.4,415.2, I guess when I actually argued with some instead of maybe just being quiet and angry was before spring break because me and a group of friends were going to Barcelona and it was just,0.889
416.7,444.8, because we're we did we plan to meet and like there's two groups so we planned to meet separately and like it in like get an Uber or go like if a friend could take us then go in their car and it was just easier that way and then but the whole group decided to come to like my apartment with me my other roommates ever going and then it would just really like had a strict schedule when to leave because of traffic was crazy during spring break,0.843
446.2,459.7, and it was just a mess kind of and then when we got to the airport we're trying to rush because we were already almost like almost late to our flights over rushing through security and,0.784
460.9,490.4, it was just a mess kind of because when we got to our gate like what we like sat down real quick and then people had to get food because it was a long flight to Barcelona and then one of our friends was like very upset to move on from the other car group and she just like saying like I have to tell you like I can't hold it in I have to tell you guys how I feel blah blah blah and then she like went off on us and she went off on us like during at security to and,0.861
490.7,518.8, just like we did was we were just basically saying like it was easier to do separate cars and stuff everybody coming to our apartment and she was saying that she felt disrespected and that she didn't like that we're trying to isolate into to several groups which we weren't I was just easier to do two separate places because they live far from us and it was just easier to go into as two separate groups are two separate cars and then get to the airport and then,0.769
519.7,549.2, it was a it was a mess and what happened and then she like kind of went off on us again when we're trying to get food and then it was just me and my other roommate so like she went off on us and everybody else is getting food or water and things like that getting ready for a flight and then I just I was just I was having enough of the argument so I kind of went off to saying like it was just like basically saying what my whole like my apartment,0.863
549.4,579.2, my roommates that went on the trip we're saying to which is like it was easier to go to separate cars and it was just it was we're trying to beat the traffic plus we had into check-in luggage and they didn't so they just kind of like went by through the kiosk and we had to go to like a person and talk to them and do weighing the bags and was just a lot more stress and we didn't know if we could pay for the bags like we couldn't do it online and they're saying that we might not be able to,0.769
579.3,608.4, at the airport so that was stressful so it's mainly what the argument was about was just like how she just was so upset that we went we didn't just get a full Uber like a big Uber for all of us it wouldn't go as one group and it was just easier because they live far from us like on the other side of the campus and we live on the other side it was just easier to go into separate cars and go but it was just it turned into an argument,0.816
627.8,657.4, situation I would have handled differently well Roberts I guess sometimes I guess when I like I'm upset I just kind of like keep them myself because I'm I just it's easier for me to like process like why I'm angry and like who's involved I guess in my angry at and I guess some of my roommates like to talk about things out loud and like I just,0.732
658.1,683.6, I have a hard time doing that and I guess I wish I can handle those situations differently I guess when we have like confrontations in my like apartment because I live with five other girls so when there are confrontations and like I like just I'm quiet about it or I like I'm quite angry I just wish I could I guess speak up more because I guess that's what they want,0.909
691.4,692.2, mmm,0.636
695.3,722.4, something I feel guilty about okay well over spring break well like my friends and I like to joke a lot and over spring break we were worried like sitting standing in a group waiting for the metro in Barcelona and we're just waiting for it or just kind of talking and then I was joking around my friend like,0.899
725.7,753.8, I like tap the back of her knee and then she was like she was laughing and she looked at me she's just laughing and then I did it again and then she went off on my like she knew it was me the whole time and she comes and she looked at me she was like Dez like she was like joking her like she was just like laughing and shaking her head and then when I did it the second time she went on on my friend that was right next to me and my friends like you've looked up Desiree,0.844
753.9,783.7, like why why are you blaming me and she's like I know it's you and Bob lot and my friends like she was laughing because it like about the situation is like no like it's not me you know it's her and she just kept like the girl like and relate because if we're in a circle and she was in the middle and then she was just like went off on my friend XR one of my roommates X me and then and then my friend of my other roommate was on the other side of like the circle and she was like I like what's going on you guys like everybody was like are you okay like you good like,0.782
783.9,800.9, why are you so upset and she was saying that she was just saying that they're like like my roommate ex me was like the girl in the middle was saying that my roommate was knocking her knees and it was me because she knew it was me the whole time which that's why I was so confused why she was yelling at her,0.763
802.5,832.1, and then my roommate on the other side like in front of the girl was like Oh you mean like this like she was like just chill like trying to figure out like what was around like sheep topped her knee and she like smacked my roommate the girl in the middle of spec my roommate we're all of a sudden the whole circle were like like well I didn't know what the time because I was like behind her and I couldn't see but everyone else was like whoa like what's going on like whoa like what happened and like what's going on now so confused I was like would like,0.824
832.3,861.9, what's going on like why's everybody like so like shocked because they were arguing before I was like what's going on and I didn't find out till the next day that like the girl in the middle smacked one of Michael my roommate and I was just like I felt so bad I was like oh my gosh I'm so sorry like I was joking around and like she didn't say it like she just looks like laughing when I did it once like she and say stop or anything and like if she said stop I would like taking it serious not just laughing and,0.776
862.8,884.7, so that I felt very guilty about and I still feel guilty about it even though it's like two weeks after spring break I just felt really bad about like how like me joke around led to all that and it just yeah I felt really bad and I kept apologizing to my roommate and yeah,0.85
888.7,891.8, tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to make,0.809
902.1,919, kind of so maybe the hardest decision I had to make was going to USC like choosing a college because I had to choose between two well I had to choose between three which was like University of Oregon,0.906
920.3,948.8, USC and my like State cannot stay College a bit the main College in my state was like University of New Mexico with that like my options because USC offered me more financial aid and I had asked the Gates Millennium Scholarship so I had to like take into consideration that but also with UNM I had a program but I was like on the waitlist like first in the waitlist for that program,0.708
949.5,955.7, which was like it's you get your bachelor's and you have a spot saved in med school and then,0.832
958.4,987, and it was paid for I think it was paid for but yeah I was just really tough decision and then Gates I just love traveling so I like I thought by leaving USC are going to USC like I just I wasn't sure if I would be happy with staying in New Mexico and like waiting to see if I would get off the waitlist and into the program and just that I know it was very hard because and then,0.82
987.4,1017.1, I got the gate later on after I got into all those like schools and the program for wait-listed for the program and then later on I found out I am I got the Gates Millennium Scholarship so then it just kind of changed everything because I was mainly like like concern about like paying for school and things like that and like Gates was able and USC offered me more financial aid so it was just easier like they basically covered my tuition and,0.83
1017.3,1031.7, unlike Keats like covers my housing so it was just a lot easier I guess to make that decision once I found out like everything's covered and like I'll be okay if I leave and yeah I guess I was just really tough decision just deciding to come here,0.719
1033.3,1033.8, yeah,0.745
1044.8,1046.6, something I regret,0.808
1051.8,1052.9, something I regret,0.807
1054.7,1083.8, I'm trying not to regret it but I do is coming to USC it's yeah it's kind of bad but I do regret coming here sometimes because I feel like I would have did academically way better back home because the freshman year here which is really tough because like I was away from home for a lot amount of time and I was put under a lot of stress with like school and pre-med classes and,0.812
1085,1114.1, like it really damaged my GPA for like the first my freshman year and a little bit into my sophomore year like getting academically like adjusted was pretty rough and so like I feel like one of the things I might regret I try not to regret but sometimes regret is coming to USC because I feel like I would have done a lot better academically at if I go took that offer at UNM and just bit on the waitlist and,0.908
1114.7,1120, I feel like it might have been a better choice but yeah,0.745

1231.4,1261, my mom and my mom and my dad fought about it and like they aren't huge argument and just it was it was a mess and I had to go to therapy and we filed charges but like it's a small town so nothing ever went ever nothing ever happened to me but I'm not sure if I wouldn't want to erase it because it did change a lot of things and I asked me be who I am today and I,0.761
1261.3,1263.4, I guess like a better person in a way,0.743
1265.6,1272.4, yeah I'm not sure if I want to reset I just would want it have to have not happened and maybe things would be different,0.812
1282,1282.4, no,0.769

1344.8,1367.1, I guess like when my friend Myra wanna my main roommate is like not consider it of things I just kind of irritates me a little bit but I guess that's what happens just the things that normal things I guess that come with living with a bunch of people but just trying to focus on school so,0.687

1467.1,1468.9, difficult I guess,0.833
1470.4,1486, they felt that their bills already not hard but it just to me it felt like a pointless maybe was just because it was like adjusted mean he's like a kid but it was in high school so it just didn't feel,0.769
1487.8,1496.4, useful to me like I would just draw things or like she would ask me things and,0.887
1497.4,1514.2, sometimes I wasn't very like receptive to what she asked but like when I was I just didn't feel like it helped me very much but I feel like if I did it now I feel like it could be more helpful because I'm more open about talking about my feelings,0.679
