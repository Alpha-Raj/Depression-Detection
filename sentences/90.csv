183.9,204.7, there's a cave in the ocean right by the house we always stay in and you swim in through the bottom but there's a little crack in the hole in the wall that's a whole and my mom always calls it our mermaid cave and I ever since I was a kid I was obsessed with mermaids so it's one of my favorite memories,0.871
213.7,223.6, I really loved English because I liked looking into literature to look for deeper meaning and I think it's important to know how to communicate,0.826
227.9,246.3, I am majoring in philosophy politics and law with a miter and friends except criminality and screenwriting so I'm interested in law and maybe being a prosecutor one day but I like creative Outlets that comes with creative writing,0.823
253.4,264.6, and I really like to write about relationships so I don't like super action-packed stuff I like to look deep into what makes people human in my writing,0.895
269.2,275.3, I'm sorry please continue oh no I'm done,0.913
287.9,292.3, I'm okay I can talk about the next thing I'm done talking about my major,0.752
304.7,325.4, a dream job I would love to be a judge because that goes with my major I'm doing right now as a student but I would love to write for a crime TV show or write a movie or in be involved in entertainment but I know it's unlikely and extremely hard to do,0.905
330.3,343.4,I'm really outgoing when I'm with people and I love to talk I'm a big talker but I do need time by myself to recharge,0.904

367.5,368.9, I can talk about my family,0.868
382.6,400.1, okay well I really like to write because it's creative and segueing into the discussion of my family I think I really want to make them Proud by being a judge or a lawyer and they don't think there's stability in writing for entertainment,0.856
405.2,426.9, I like to watch TV because I like to write for a TV and I spend a lot of time with my friends and I watch a lot of pretty dumb YouTube videos or makeup tutorials because I like makeup and I do my makeup to relax sometimes,0.91
434.8,460.9, I'm really good at controlling my temper I get extremely irritable really quickly and I have a hard time like dealing with a lot of people sometimes like I have really good friends but I get mad at them really easily but I never outwardly express it which makes me feel bad sometimes because I can absolutely hate someone but they'll never know it,0.726
465.3,481.2, just not gotten you in trouble no that's never gotten me in trouble if anything it keeps the peace and that's what I like to do I like to be a peacemaker and a problem solver and sometimes that puts my feelings on the back burner because I don't want to hurt other people,0.862
490.8,519.9, oh it was a political conversation with my friend who has very different political ideals than I do and honestly it was on the topic of abortion because I feel very strongly about you know pro-choice and getting women their rights and he refused to see any side of my argument and simply like declined to even listen to me saying that he was right,0.828
526,553.8, which was really frustrating because I went into the conversation trying to respect his views and I was constantly like I see where you're coming from and then obviously I would try and you know refute back in a polite way but he absolutely wouldn't even listen to anything I was trying to say because a lot of his arguments were religion-based and you kind of you know there's not a lot of room for arguing there it's very strict,0.895
558.8,588.4,oh sorry go on a situation which I had had handled better one of them was probably a in building government I'm a programmer so I planted thence and the president is a little narcissistic and sometimes very rude to girls and I didn't handle that well I called him out and I kind of took charge of the situation which made him really,0.9
588.6,593, set and honestly just made situations worse even though I do think I did the right thing,0.895
604.2,630.2, okay well that's what I just said I situation with the president of building government I kind of took charge on a programming event and he wanted to be in charge and he definitely belittled me in the other girls in the room which frustrates me because equality is important to me and I did not handle it well because it was my event and he made me feel like less of a person and I called him out and it was awkward but I,0.782
630.5,631.8, I still think I did the right thing,0.744
638.5,639.1, that's it,0.908
647.2,648.4, I feel guilty about,0.801
650.5,679, I guess my weight because I constantly say I'm going to make a change and be healthy and go to the gym and I can do it for like one day and then I don't continue and I know that I should be healthier for my family and for myself and you know just making a better change in my life for a better me and when I don't make that change I feel like I'm like really just letting myself down and letting my family down and,0.835
681.1,682.6, I get really disappointed,0.855
688.2,717.5, and it's extra hard I guess because my parents are both overweight and so it's hard to have someone to like look up to and like see that it's you know a healthy lifestyle is a sustainable lifestyle but I also grew up like I had a minor eating disorder when I was in Middle School but like now my sister definitely has an eating disorder and she goes to the gym for like 3 hours every day in high school and so I've never really had an experience of which,0.774
718,737.1, healthy lifestyle was actually implemented in a healthy way like it always went too far or just was never implemented and it scares me because I don't want to go back to a point where like I wasn't eating anything my hair was falling out like there's like a very fine line that I have yet to find and it scares me,0.912
747.5,776.9, I think it was honestly where to go to college because I got into some good places and then I really didn't get into a lot of places I wanted to go to and I was really disappointed because I didn't know what I wanted to do and I felt really stressed out because I like how can you expect an eighteen-year-old to know where they want to go and what they want to do with their lives and since I've come to school here I've changed my major three times already and now I'm happy in my major but picking,0.853
777,779.2, where to go for school was,0.816
780.5,781.8, really difficult for me,0.857
789.6,811.7, and I tried I was picking between going all the way to New York or here and I ultimately chose here for a campus Because I like having a campus and being a little bit closer to my family in Northern California because I'm really close with them and I can't imagine being like 5 hours away in a different time zone unable to come home if I really felt homesick,0.854
822.2,822.7, um,0.863
824.8,853.9, I I regret not being more confident I think in high school and even now and putting myself out there like it's just so dumb but like every week my grandma calls and asks if I found a boyfriend yet and yeah I'm over I'm like overweight and so I have like I think my confidence is just kind of low body-wise even though like mentally I think I'm really awesome and I just wish I,0.843
854.1,870.7, put myself out there more and so dumb but like I don't know just be more flirty and make myself more of like you know like a person that you can flirt with instead of like an intelligent rock that just likes to have like debates and do homework and stuff like that,0.868
884,897, oh well back I mean just on the flirty thing there was you know just like if you if I really liked someone for a really long time I just never did anything about it so yeah but I can do the next question,0.8
903,905, I can do yeah next question is good,0.77
912.3,926.8, no I don't know I don't like I have yeah no I have not and I have family that have served and I don't know they had a really hard time with it,0.702
940.2,964.9, I've been feeling stressed because like midterms and everything is coming up and I have a really busy next few weeks that are like is pretty overwhelming but I've also been feeling kind of down and you know I know that if I feel this way for too long like I should really like talk to someone because like I've been in this situation of just down and I mean depressed like I know the,0.908
965.5,972.9, of it so I don't feel like I'm there yet but I just been feeling a little feeling off past few weeks,0.806
983.5,1008.3, I mean like I said like I kind of was like mentioning I've just feel like a little more down I still feel like I can do my work I'm just a little less motivated a little less creative and I don't spend as much time with my friends anymore like I need time to myself a little bit more and just like quiet me time and I get a little bit more irritable,0.767
1008.5,1026.5, on like I know the classic symptoms like I love like my in I do improv and I love that but like lately I'm just a little less into it so I'm not concerned yet but I'm I'm aware that in a little like I'm aware that I feel a little down a little different,0.786
1038.4,1063.2, I can sleep really well I get stomach aches in the middle of the night sometimes but I fall asleep with headphones on listening to like a podcast because if I'm not listening to something I kind of like my mind kind of races so I listen to podcasts to fall asleep because I can focus on what someone else is saying instead of what I'm thinking but I can sleep throughout through the night,0.899
1068.2,1097.8, I am horrible like I'm so irritable I like judge everyone in my head and I can't stand anyone and I just like want to get my work done and then just be by myself and like go to sleep like I'm very aware that I am not a fun person to be around when I'm tired and so I really dedicate myself to like getting sleep I leave my friends like early in the night like early in the night when,0.913
1098,1103, all hanging out and doing homework so that I can go and get my sleep for the sake of everyone else around me,0.812
1110.5,1126.5, but that's about it in high school in high school I was like I was depressed and I was on medicine for it and like I just know them like I could not sleep like at all I would toss and turn all night and I could only take naps at like 3:00 p.m. so compared to then I sleep so much better now,0.904
1135.2,1164.7, I definitely think therapy is useful like I mentioned in high school like I'm now no longer I don't I feel a lot better than I did in high school but I found that talking to someone like every other week was just so nice because there was someone there to help you go through your thoughts and kind of you know be on your side like a cheerleader for you and I like I really miss going to therapy just because you know it was just someone there to kind of,0.849
1165.1,1188.5, help you get through your thoughts and any anxieties or issues that you're dealing with in your life and it really is just having like a little person rooting you on and helping you through the rough stuff that goes on in your mind because to me I think the internal and mental problems that people face are just as challenging as physical ones,0.804
1202.8,1227.4, well 10 years ago I would have been like a really little kid um but I would have said just like love yourself and don't let you know people get to you and pick on you because you're wonderful and you're smart and you can succeed and then also don't stress and don't worry too much about the future,0.902
1227.6,1245.2, teacher live in the moment because if you always wish for the future and like you know as a kid saying I can't wait till I'm 16 and I can drive I can't wait I can't wait until I'm in college like no like that will happen eventually but live in the moment and love the moment,0.855
1251.4,1252.1, I think so too,0.834
1265,1266.2, really happy,0.909
1271.3,1272.3, I think,0.793
1274.4,1304.1, I felt Happy on the last vacation I went on which was over went her break I you know we were on a boat ride and we got to see dolphins and turtles and that was kind of just like amazement but like genuine happiness and like wanting to cry from happiness was at the beginning of the school year when I auditioned and got into an improv troupe on campus because like I didn't think I was gonna get in an improv has a big part of like myself expression and also,0.807
1304.2,1317, you automatically make some friends through that and you kind of have a family on campus and so I was just so thankful and so happy and just like taken aback by how happy I was that I had gotten into the troop,0.894
1335.2,1365.2, a positive influence I think for me I everybody in my life I'm a pretty critical person so everybody in my life I see both the pros and cons that they've had on my life for example my mom was like really hard to live with in middle school because she had like really bad back pain and depression and that was really hard for me but since then I have seen her get better and work harder,0.897
1365.2,1382.9, hard on getting better and you know she's just so smart and she's a great mom and can balance work and her own life and I am just like really proud of her and I'm proud to call her my mom yeah,0.847
1395.2,1407.7, well I've known my best friend since I was three years old she's my neighbor so I think she'd call me quirky weird trustworthy,0.844
1409.3,1410.7, intuitive,0.727
1413,1428.5, just I don't know we can tell each other anything and we can go months without seeing each other and we get back and everything's fine and we're just goof balls so I think that she sees me as a really funny yet trustworthy and compassionate person,0.832
1447.7,1475.1, oh okay well I have like a big group of friends like 10 of us and one of my friends parents flew in and they took us out like all of us out to a nice fancy dinner and it was just like so nice to meet really genuine kind people that were willing to pay to feed like 10 college-age students and they were,0.901
1475.3,1505.1, really interesting people and really compassionate and it was really cool to see like my friends parents because she's so much like them and I think all of us are just excited to like get on the town and have a really nice meal and not have to worry about the price and meeting nice people I was really exciting to like Meet the Parents and put our best foot forward and to me I find it it's really fun to introduce myself to people and like so that was a really fun too,0.773
1505.2,1512.7, to introduce myself and try and put the best foot forward so that they know who their daughter spending so much time with,0.863
1517.4,1525.3,that's a big one,0.795
1529.9,1531, I think,0.789
1532.7,1551.8, most proud of I don't know I think a lot of it is like my relationships with people that I'm really close to I'm really close to my family and like my sister and I never fight we're super close and I have a best friend that I never like I honestly never worry about us not being friends back home and,0.892
1553.4,1573.3, I don't know that is like one of my biggest accomplishments that I have really made an effort to be close with people that really matter to me and I mean I'm also really proud of just the goals that you know I'm I just I am high for my life and I don't I don't see myself settling anytime soon so that is really exciting for me,0.819
1583.6,1584, thank you,0.785
