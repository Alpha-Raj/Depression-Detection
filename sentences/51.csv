31.3,31.8, yes,0.905
45.9,50.5, I'm okay a little stressed about work but that's fine,0.886
56.7,57.9, I'm from Phoenix,0.819
69.3,82.4, I really like being around the beach and having access to the beach I'm going there with my friends and then just being at USC and being close to my friends as really nice,0.809
91.6,109.6, it's really crowded and there's a lot of people and traffic of course so in general I prefer to be in a more like natural environment where there's more outdoor stuff because around USC there's not as much but if I'm able to get around La then it's fine,0.91
123.9,131.9, I would like to travel more than I do but whenever I can yes for spring break I went to Spain and that was really fun,0.818
145.7,159.2, meeting new people seeing new places and new food of course and then just seeing all these places that I've only seen in pictures before and making new friends and new places is really fun,0.841
168.7,198.2, so over spring break I went to Spain and I stayed with my friend from high school who studying abroad there and so we're ready Madrid and this really cute neighborhood called Mala Sonia and so most of the days I just spent around there and so with my friend we'd go on the Metro or just walk around the area and go to new restaurants went to a bunch of museums and then a few days she had class so then I got to walk around on myself and I really,0.766
198.4,198.9, that,0.739
210.5,237, I would say going to Italy after freshman year I stayed with a family there for a month and a half and I was in Sicily and so I was there teaching English to the daughters who are about my age so then because there are my age to I just hung out with them for a lot of the time and there was lots of going to the beach we went hiking a bunch is really fun,0.822
251.9,266, I always enjoyed my science classes I found them to be like pretty challenging in the moment but at the end I think I was came out feeling pretty good knowing that I'd learned a lot and even though it was hard it was good to be challenged I think,0.807
274.4,294.6, I'm a student and I'm majoring in cognitive science minoring in Italian and computer science and then outside of class I work in a research lab called the computational social science lab and I help teach a computer science class,0.798
309.3,310, I didn't say anything,0.803
334.2,348.7, I was at least for a short time teach English abroad and besides that I would like to be a software engineer or user experience designer,0.901
358.1,359.2, definitely more shy,0.908
362,364.4, but after a while I guess I open up,0.825
376.5,385.4, I guess it takes a while for me to get to know someone and feel comfortable around them but once I am like around my really good friends I'm not that shy at all,0.898
397.9,418.6, I'm closest with my mom and my dad more or less but I have two brothers and a sister and I'm not that close with them especially when I'm at school we don't really talk that much but sometimes we'll tax if there's like somebody's birthday or something and then just catch up every once in awhile,0.848
428.8,446.4, I like hanging out with my friends usually just sat like somebody's apartment or going to the gym I really think those are fun and going to the beach reading cooking playing with my dogs if I'm at home yeah,0.812
456.2,467.7, I'm okay to go I just have to like walk away from the conversation and take a minute to myself and we listen to music to calm myself down I don't like really like explode at people,0.864
481.4,496.2, I can't remember the last time I actually argued with someone it might have been just at home like over winter break with my sister about something dumb like cleaning the bathroom or something normally don't argue with people,0.905
520,549.1, I think sometimes in my relationships I have trouble communicating what I'm feeling or just being open so with a friend of mine right now we're not really talking and I'm not sure why and I've tried to ask her what's up but she doesn't really respond so I think I need to be more open about what I'm doing and because with the end of the school year coming up I don't want there to be any time wasted because we're both graduating,0.855
550.4,560, so I feel like a little bit earlier than now even I should have reached out and try to see what was happening between us,0.861
580.2,608.6, in high school I was going through like a hard time with mental and physical health and so I know during that time my mom did a lot for me and it was really hard on her to seem like that and then also to have to take care of me so much so I feel a little bit guilty that I wasn't thankful for to thankful to her during that time and then we haven't really like talked about it so I wish,0.9
610,616.3, I feel guilty for maybe not being us thankful to her as I should be,0.886
630.2,654.9, I think probably during that same time during high school I had to choose to get better and be more open about what I was feeling in order to get better with my mental health so it wasn't like one decision and time it was more of a decision to make that I had to make every day but it was hard for like a few years,0.846
670.8,699.5, during probably at the beginning of high school my sister and I were really getting along and like there was one night when we were kind of arguing and I think from then on like things were always a little bit different between us and so we're kind of distant and so again I wish there had been more communication like on my part and maybe that would have helped things,0.789
699.6,704.4, um so I regret becoming more distant from her about like dumb things,0.806
719,725.7, I don't really think there is anything that I wish I could forget our race from a memory,0.827
735.5,736, no,0.781
751.3,772.7, been feeling okay there's like some things I need to change about like my attitude I guess I've been realizing talking to my friends about but so I know that's like hard and it's going to be like a process but overall okay,0.905
783.1,788.6, not really but I think there needs to be,0.872
801.2,808.6, that's usually pretty okay just with traveling and getting back the past few days I've been jet lag but no might okay,0.878
824.3,833.6, I'm more irritable and my friends say I get more sassy but that's like if it's,0.909
835.3,844.3, like gone on for like a few days that I haven't gone sleep but if it's just like one night I'm usually pretty okay sometimes trouble focusing but yeah,0.881
856.5,857.5, yeah I think so,0.794
866,887.8, so in high school like I was talking about before I had problems with mental health and so I had to go to therapy for that and I really hated it at first because I didn't want talk to anyone about it but in the end I think it was really helpful and I think even now that I don't go it probably would be a helpful thing just to talk to someone,0.764
896.7,918, well 20 years ago I was only two years old so 10 years ago I would say that just to be more confident in whatever I want to do my opinions what I want to wear what I want to say and it's okay to make mistakes,0.824
919.5,920.6, and I'll be perfect,0.729
942.6,964.2, I would say this past week being with my friend who I hadn't seen in a few months and getting to see how she's doing in Spain and then just experiencing experiencing a new place and new people to and it was really fun and I felt pretty happy when I was there,0.865
979.4,1007.2, one of my really good friends she's been really good for me because I think she is very different from me she's a lot more outgoing extroverted and more upfront about what she's feeling and what she wants and so seeing an example of someone doing that is really inspiring for me as someone who's not as much like that who would like to be more like that,0.835
1017.3,1018, I think,0.854
1020,1022.6, one of them would probably say that,0.852
1026.7,1046.5, I'm like a little bit reserved at first but once you get to know me I'm more like I said sassy more witty determined and motivated,0.9
1058,1063.7, so in one of the club's I'm in we do,0.863
1065.9,1093.8, powerlifting and so there was like an informal competition one day where you had to basically dead lift your body weight as many times as you could and so I want out of everyone and it was a really fun time and then also I'd never really lived it in front of people so it was a new experience but really fun and I think show me that I want to do more of that in the future,0.822
1112.5,1117.3, I don't really know if there's like one thing I just,0.887
1119.7,1143.2, there's like smaller things I don't feel like there's one big thing at all but probably just more like self-development that I've had over the years and being willing to try new challenging things and then sticking with them as they even though if they're hard but it typically comes out pretty well,0.905
