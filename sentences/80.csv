1328,1329.2, can you repeat the question,0.91
1341.8,1368.9, it's kind of hard to cuz I was like most of the time like when I'm not in school I'm like falling like sports whether it be like soccer or football like same thing like this been like constant since like middle school and high school I so I guess I was like a lot of athletes that you know they're like positive people because I like I see what they do it like off the field and I think that's like really meaningful you know like giving back to their,0.816
1369,1398.8, communities like giving back to like little kids whether it be like I don't know taking them like sponsoring a field trip or some toy drive or something I don't know there's like very things they do and I think that's like really positive but as far as like someone specific I don't know and I know that's just like in sports not an athlete I'm a student so it's kind of hard to like connect the two but I think like overall,0.913
1399,1414.4, I like the message that the send about giving back I think that's like really positive I like even though like they had like you know difficult circumstances in their childhoods growing up like they were so able to overcome them and I don't know I think that's like really great,0.87

1507.1,1509.1, I really haven't done anything like,0.775
1511,1539.3, I don't know like but yeah I think that would definitely have to be like my biggest like proudest moment is like being a student here at USC I don't know like right now I tell myself that like I'll achieve something once I get like my bachelors like walking and like walking the stage but I also feel like I Know Myself and I feel like once I get to that point I'll probably be like oh no they're still like more to go like I'm not even finished yet so like I feel like I set my I set the bar like like,0.859
1539.8,1549.9, I feel like I'll really like never I mean obviously like I'll achieve some things but inside I feel like I really haven't because there's so much more to do and they're really is like at the same time I feel like,0.861
