309.4,335.6, I'm I would say I'm pretty good I've i'mi'm really patient person because I work with kids like I've been working with kids since I was 13 years old so like through that I've kind of learned to like give people the benefit of the doubt and also just like take the time to understand where people are coming from I don't think I've ever gotten like very angry and in a very very long time,0.909
339.9,369.5,hmm it's like a very like serious argument I would say with my friends with my best friend because his roommate had said something like very sexist towards me and I didn't really appreciate it but he didn't understand like why I was upset so I think that just like really upset me how he couldn't understand where I was coming from and we like had a really long discussion about it and I think it came to like,0.807
369.7,386.8, really I guess like a really good I think he learned a lot from what we talked about like about the way I feel like the way that like men treat women and it's like so subtle like these kind of misogynistic things that I kind of there but like guys don't really see it so yeah yeah,0.861
399.8,402.5, oh no I was done talking about that,0.88

520.2,531.5, dip sorry please go on um I think I'm just going to try to answer your question so a situation where I wish I handled it differently,0.827
533.6,562.2, I think there's like a one time I was supposed to go in for an interview for this internship but I woke up and I just like did not want to go and I kind of knew like a couple days before that this isn't something that I wanted to do but honestly I feel bad for like wasting that person's time because I just like emailed them and called them like 10 minutes before I was supposed to come in and said that I was sick but I should have just been more honest earlier on,0.869
563.3,564.5, so that's on me,0.828
578.6,579.8, I think you're broken,0.796
596.4,621.3, okay so I'm going to answer your question with the same situation because you asked me the same question but yeah just I had an interview and I honestly didn't want to go like a couple days before but I was like you should just do it for experience and then the day of I decided I didn't want to go so I sent them a message like 10 minutes before and I said I wasn't coming that I was sick which was a lie but I don't know,0.908
621.6,625.2, didn't want to go and that kind of was bad on me I should have been more responsible,0.692
639.2,664.1, I feel guilty about I feel guilty about not reaching out to the students that I Mentor through this organization that I work with I don't reach out to them enough at least and I feel like I might it might be too late for me to try and like have a better relationship with them so that's something I definitely feel guilty that I should have I should still like try to dedicate more time to talking to them,0.862
677.9,707, oh um the hardest decision I guess College picking a school I had no idea where I wanted to go it came down to like this school USC Berkeley and UCLA and honestly I picked random I think I just picked what was closest to home yeah am I happy with it I think so,0.909
707.8,717.7, it was just really hard for me to choose because I did not know what I want to do wanted to do back then and I still don't really know that well but us he's pretty great so,0.889
733.5,737, I guess mmm,0.816
740.4,766.4, I don't know this is a hard question because I don't really think that you should like regret anything I think maybe you should like learn or everyone should just like learn from their past and appreciate that like the things that happened can teach them something even if it like didn't come out the way they wanted it to but maybe like if I were to say one thing I regret it's I regret like not,0.892
769.8,786.6, I don't know I mean I guess I regret not taking like a full 18 units every semester or like trying some like to unit electives my freshman year this will play something so I could have I could have learned like a new skill but also I feel like I learned a lot regardless so yeah,0.88
796,825.8, something that I wish I could erase all right so this one's a lot but when I was in high school my Twitter account I kind of was out like as a bisexual person and my parents don't really know but my mom found it somehow and it was an ordeal it was a bit of a mess she was banging on my door I was thinking about like climbing out the window,0.887
826.1,843.8, go to escape and then I had to convince her that I was straight and I wish I could forget that that ever happened but it did maybe you know I think it was also really important that that happened to but it's something that just like bothers me from time to time so,0.738
854.4,854.8, no,0.77
870.1,876.1, it's like a roller coaster I guess I'm happy,0.862
877.5,907.1, with the people in my life and like how lucky I am to have so many people that care about me but I also feel like I'm like personally wasting a lot of my time like watching Netflix instead of creating work or or being productive in ways that like I feel like personally would benefit me like drawing or or dancing these are things that I have in or writing these are things I haven't been able to do because of,0.874
907.4,916.1, like school and the way that I've been managing my time and it feels like I kind of need those things to like keep me balanced so,0.819
935.5,958.6, not significantly I guess I've was sleeping a lot more this weekend I think it's but I think that's just like a result of me like pushing myself through midterms and like not sleeping that much during the week so that's like a pretty like a standard student thing to do I'm not healthy thing but yeah,0.86
963.1,985.5, usually it's pretty easy actually I try to go to bed before midnight waking up is kind of hard I'm not really a morning person but I do get up and I'm usually ready and I make it on to class on time so I usually get like eight hours of sleep at least,0.91
995.6,1015, like low energy sometimes I mix up the words that I'm saying like things kind of just don't make sense or I just feel like so exhausted that I kind of to fake my way through the day see yeah that's usually how I am if I don't get enough sleep,0.894
1018.5,1019.1, okay,0.739
1022.5,1039.1, yeah I think so I mean it's a good way to like clear up your thoughts and like figure out what's going on with your head because sometimes life can get really confusing you don't really take the time to like understand yourself,0.878
1053,1077.8, well 20 years ago I would not have been alive but 10 years ago I think I think I would have told myself to not take everything so seriously they are so stressed about grades look even when I was in Middle School I would I worked so hard to be valedictorian of my class but you know like the night,0.789
1077.9,1091.5, I didn't sleep and all that stuff like I was never taken care of myself sometimes I wouldn't even shower and it was it was like you know you got to take care of yourself first before you can like deal with all these external stuff so yeah,0.816
1113.4,1143, I've been well mmm I'm trying to think what I did this weekend oh so we had a special event for the students that we teach in the organization that I'm in and we went to Santa Monica and we just sat in a room and like saying a lot of songs together and we went to arcades and played games and the guy that was working there he was really nice so he gave us all free Power,0.809
1143.2,1150.8, prizes even though we didn't have tickets so yeah I think I felt like really happy there was just like a really good day,0.841
1170.3,1178.4, I don't know what else to say about that day I mean I was with all my friends too even though it was raining on the beach it was still pretty fun so,0.853
1184,1188, sorry please go on,0.864
1192.1,1194.5, hmm I think it's glitching again,0.842
1199.5,1204.3, yeah that day,0.869
1205.5,1209, also I mean I'd lost my umbrella that day actually,0.889
1211.4,1222.4, I need an umbrella because it's raining now but it was still a good day and I got to know the girls that I teach a lot better which was nice,0.911
1243.4,1263.3, it's been a positive influence in my life I would say is my Grandma she's like one of my best friends like I was talking to her earlier and we was just have a really good time together and she's very supportive of me and my sister and like my family and she's also like one of the nicest people,0.729
1264.6,1271.6, ever see ya used to go to her house just live down the street we go to her house all the time and just hang out,0.89
1280.7,1304.2, my best friend probably describe me is like really outgoing and people say I have a good sense of humor I don't want to say that for myself because I maybe like a little a little conceited but I think that they're right so I am a little conceited too yeah I guess I assumed like really determined,0.878
1306,1312.6, but I also like to chill I think that's how my best friend would describe me,0.891
1322.9,1323.8, recently,0.818
1326.8,1329.6, something that I did recently I,0.797
1335.6,1357.1, today we were teaching again and we were doing like a reveal for who would be mentoring which student so I helped like put that together and we blew up balloons and like wrote all the girls names on the balloons like really nice so yeah that's something I really enjoy doing,0.907
1367.6,1396.2, I'm most proud of I guess I try my best to stay true to who I am I mean maybe sometimes like I don't know who that is but like I have I think I have like a pretty good sense of self and what makes me comfortable like what doesn't and also like asserting myself in situations that just make me uncomfortable like I kind of I kind of know like what my limits are and,0.906
1397.3,1418.2, also not afraid to try harder for like learning new things which I think is really important and I don't like ever ever compromise who I am or what my values are just feel like the enjoyment of other people I guess or like to be accepted that's not that's not something that I subscribe to,0.879
1429.7,1430.4, no problem,0.725
