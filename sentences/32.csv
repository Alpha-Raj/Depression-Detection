23,23.5,okay,0.832
25.2,25.6, yeah,0.913
37.6,46, I'm okay I've been a little tired and I've had some allergies but overall not too bad a little tired yeah but overall okay,0.86
53.2,57.8, so I was boring outside of Chicago but I spent most of my life in Colorado,0.811
67,86.9, I really like all of the people and the opportunities also some of my extended family lives out here so it's been nice even though I'm away from home to still see them I saw them this past weekend also the weather has been awesome Colorado's pretty cold as of now so it's been pretty nice and just I guess the closeness of everything,0.907
96,125.6, could be better and transportation to other places it's nice to get to like the beach to just take the metro but besides that I usually end up taking like a lift which can get a little pricey and also going off of that the price of things I feel like is a little bit more than some other states especially Colorado in terms of like rent and even food and gas and stuff like that,0.756
137.6,158.7, yeah I tried to so I've have family in the east coast and so I go back there a lot and then I've also been out of the country a couple times with an orchestra we've been to like Bulgaria Japan Germany and some other European countries so not extremely a lot but I've definitely been able to travel in my life,0.77
168,193.2, I really like getting immersed in the culture so as I mentioned when I visited like Bulgaria in Japan we were able to stay with like host families and so just living with them and being able to see what they do on a daily routine I mean you can like read about all the stuff as much as you want but then if you don't actually like immerse yourself it's you don't really fully understand what other cultures value and what they do on a day-to-day basis so I've really enjoyed that,0.858
201.3,228.7, yeah so the summer of my senior year I'm a sophomore in college but the summer of my senior year in high school like I said with the orchestra we went to Germany and Czech Republic and so we just went around to a whole bunch of different different cities and just played a whole bunch of classical music and I was I play percussion so I played marimba and also on the,0.767
228.9,246.5, if I was chosen for like a soloist for a concerto and so I was able to play marimba piece all throughout Germany and I Prague Berlin and so that was really fun and then living with families throughout that ship was also an incredible experience,0.834
256.3,262.9, most memorable I would say that,0.887
264,275, it would probably be in Japan which was my sophomore year we visited Mount Fuji I'm going to able to hike that and,0.861
276.6,291.4, it was just really cool like being with people that I've known like for a lot of my life and just hiking this mountain together really like brought us closer and it's such a beautiful place and just seeing like their culture again was incredible,0.912
301.7,325.2, besides academics I really liked band I don't know if that's considered the subject but I was in band all throughout High School junior high since fourth grade and so I really enjoyed that and then academic lies I really like science I'm a neuroscience major right now and so I've really enjoyed just learning all about the body and things we could do since we still don't know a lot,0.852
332.9,349.4, so now as I've alluded to I'm a second-year student at USC studying neuroscience and minoring in percussion performance and so just on that track of potentially researching the relationship between the two or going to med school,0.893
370,394.7, would love to potentially have my own business I have no like business experience but being able to like own a business that could like impact people like I know a lot of businesses do that kind of model where if you buy something they're able to use some of the profits to impact a third world country or some people in need and so I didn't go on the track I'm going on now that might be my other option,0.909
406.8,433.8, I think internally I'm an introvert but living in kind of like an extroverted area in just being in college I've learned to be able to be open and everything but at the end of the day I really enjoyed just kind of like sitting in bed maybe watching TV by myself but I also enjoy talking with people during the day so I guess ambivert but I like both alone time and talking with people,0.846
440.8,458.4, so actually that's it interesting question because my parents are currently going through a divorce but it's been okay I think they've realized that I've been kind of in the middle but,0.907
461.7,490.3, now I think they're working through it but my mom I've lived with my whole life my dad actually was working for a while when I was in high school in another state when they were still together and so I'm still close with both of them but if live with my mom more throughout my life and then I've also grown up in a house living with like a Down syndrome and and so that's taught me a lot about myself and also my grandma lived with us for a little bit as well so I guess I would say,0.913
490.5,509.4, really have like the normal like family environment growing up but I wouldn't change it for anything I love them all deeply and I also have a sibling to Sibling a younger sister and an older brother my brother will be graduating this may from college and my sister is a freshman in high school,0.894
516.4,522.2, as I mentioned I play music I really like playing piano and percussion I'm also,0.881
523.5,529.6, a big fan of sleep if I ever get stressed sometimes like a 20-minute nap will just be able to calm me down a lot,0.782
532.4,546.7, managers I would say normal things relaxing in bed I also have a good support system with my siblings and some other friends so if I am really stressed out about something on my mind I know I'm also able to talk to them as well,0.846
554.3,583.9, I would say I'm fairly good at controlling that I've had people noticed that I have I don't know they said I appeared to be very calm and collected when I'm speaking with them but in terms of how I control it I I mean I I think coming through college I just realized like it's not worth it getting like really emotionally involved in like the little things I used to do that but I think I've grown out of it and just realized that a lot of the things that I would be worked,0.786
584.1,589.4, on aren't worth my time and so just not getting worked up on them in the first place really helps,0.891
602.1,631.3, I'm last time I argued with someone which probably last semester as I mentioned my parents are going through a divorce and so just kind of talking with them to let them know like I don't want to be involved in length there I guess drama and the things between them both of them try to sometimes ask me to do things and directly to help the other person so I guess I just thought a little bit with both of them but it was constructive enough where we both kind of agreed and were able to improve,0.864
632.2,635.7, on how we spoke with each other in that manner,0.834
648.6,651.1, yeah so um let me think,0.909
653.8,682.8, so I'm an RA right now in a housing at USC and I'm not the best at being assertive that's one of I think my weaknesses and so I guess just we had an incident where there's like marijuana but I wasn't assertive enough and I didn't get all the information I needed and so I guess in the future if I just come up again I would definitely try to stick my ground and be there and I've learned from it but just to answer your,0.777
683.1,685, and that's the situation,0.835
697.4,725.1, I feel guilty about not being there for my sister who so my sister actually moved out of my mom's house in Colorado to live with my dad who's in Boise this year and I feel like I want to be there for her but also I feel guilty because it seems like she doesn't she's not on good terms with my mom and so I feel kind of in the middle and I don't really know like I don't want to choose,0.854
725.3,729.3, side but I feel bad either way when I like help one of them,0.803
746.3,747.4, I would say,0.752
749.9,779.1, going to college that was really hard to choose which one I wanted to go to USC was definitely one of the more expensive ones versus I would have gone in state if I didn't and so just making that choice was really hard for me because I knew it would be hard for the family and I guess going back to the guilty question I also really feel guilty about that but at the same time they also agreed and they saw the potential and the opportunities at USC and so that was just a hard decision to choose,0.863
779.3,781.2, tween out of state or in state,0.782
797.1,798.4, I regret,0.656
800.1,801, let me think,0.844
807.6,836.8, okay um I regret I guess moving away from my family especially in this time as I mentioned so my brother goes to school in Colorado so he's been able to be there like for example my mom had the flu this past weekend he was able to drive down and I'm just kind of like left everyone and went away and so I regret a little bit moving so far away but at the same time I'm happy with the decision I've made,0.913
837,839.2, because it's given me a lot of opportunities,0.864
854.4,882.5, yeah so um something that was hard last semester was I was falsely accused of cheating on an exam somebody cheated off of me and I had no idea and then ready go to S Jacks which is like the student judicial office here at USC and I requested the video footage of the day of the exam to see if that could like prove my innocence but anyways long story short,0.844
882.9,912.6, you start against me and then said like I had I was doing like movements that were curious and they weren't responding to emails and forgot about meetings and it was just the whole situation was very unorganized and they even wanted to give me an f and then I ended up a peeling it and they realized they had no evidence so I didn't get an F but anyways just the whole situation was handled very poorly I think and so being able to erase that would be,0.844
912.8,916, phenomenal because it definitely caused a lot of stress on me and my family,0.745
926.9,927.3, no,0.755
938.1,951, I'm good as I mentioned in the beginning just a little bit tired and my allergies have been acting up but overall this has been a really good year I think a lot of opportunities classes are going well,0.907
953.6,963.1, these last few weeks have been pretty laid-back no midterms or anything but coming up it's going to be probably a little more stressful academically but overall definitely manageable,0.805
977.3,1003.9, not really Behavior I guess I just feel more tired recently I don't know if that's just I don't know why but I've definitely taken a lot more naps and overall just a little bit kind of less energetic I don't know if that's because like I'm taking an allergy pill to help me with my allergies or just that I've had a lot more on my plate this semester but I would say that's the only behavioral change,0.825
1009.2,1034, definitely I love sleep I can like fall asleep right away I try to go to bed around between 12 and 1 and then I usually wake up around like a and so I try to get seven eight hours but as I mentioned recently I've been getting yeah seven eight hours plus like a nap or two in the day because I've been feeling a little tired,0.775
1041.4,1060.8, it's really hard for me to concentrate I know that some people can function with very minimal asleep but if I get like less than 5 hours I just feel completely exhausted throughout the whole day and then just kind of like a foggy kind of mind and it's hard for me to pay attention to things,0.771
1072.8,1080.5, yeah I definitely think so and I've tried it and it's been helpful to just kind of talk to somebody so yeah,0.912
1087.4,1116.6, sure so last year I went to a therapist I haven't gone a lot but I went once which was the same therapist as my dad and I was able to talk this was one of the divorce kind of just started so I was able to talk a lot about that and it was I don't really like to talk too much I didn't at first like to talk too much about like what was going on but just being able to kind of vent to someone was really helpful,0.911
1117.2,1118.1, um yeah,0.698
1129.8,1155.2, I think I also mentioned this before but I would just tell them don't worry about the small things I remember in like Elementary School junior high high school I would stress out so much about like really small projects and like assignments and I would get because I really wanted to like do really well but looking back they really didn't mean anything in the long run and so I just say don't worry about the small things so much,0.836
1171.1,1194.8, so really happy there have been quite a few times this last weekend I was really enjoyed it I went to an album release for one of my friends she's like a singer and so it was really cool that was a really fun time just to be able to be with her and some family members were there as well and just support her and everything so it's really fun,0.838
1199.3,1200.2, it's great,0.912
1207.7,1224.2, my aunt lives in early California and she's definitely been a positive influence and kind of role model and has helped me I've been able to talk to her a lot about the divorce and everything and she's just been able to give me a lot of good advice about that and school-related issues,0.882
1234.1,1236.9, I would say laid-back funny,0.845
1239.3,1241.5, carrying maybe yeah,0.869
1253,1256.7, I would say something I did recently would be,0.858
1258.7,1261.4, oh hang on I don't know if I'm supposed to answer that,0.871
1265.4,1267.6, hello how far I didn't know if I was supposed to answer that,0.629
1269.4,1271, okay perfect,0.796
1280.9,1292.2, how was it yeah okay so next we're going to have you fill out,0.911
