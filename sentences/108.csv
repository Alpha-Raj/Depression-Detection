26.7,27.2, yes,0.832
32.2,32.8, yes,0.905
43.4,50.8, I'm good today's a busy day lots of school work that needs to be done this week so yeah,0.901
57,59.3, Huntington Beach California is where I grew up,0.884
73.1,84.5, I like that there's a lot to do in the area so the museums are really neat I found some pretty cool hikes recently I really like hiking and I think there's a lot of different neighborhoods,0.844
86.8,88.9, the traffic definitely the traffic,0.865
101.5,102, yes,0.762
108.8,117.6, I like being able to see new places and for me it's really fun just to keep trying and doing new things and meeting new people,0.912
126.1,139.8, so I went to London recently and saw it was just a really fun trip because there's so much history and culture there so I had a really great time just being able to explore the city that was my favorite part I think of that trip,0.77
140.9,143, plus afternoon tea I really like afternoon tea,0.787
151.9,169.8, I'm gonna go back to that trip actually because my fiance was able to join me and so that was really nice just being able to kind of share my love with the city for like with him and kind of show him around because I've been several times and and that was his first time first or second time so it was really nice,0.913
178.9,190.7, psychology obviously I'm a Psychology major so I just find psychology really fascinating and so I love any psychology course I can take I've tried to take as many as I can,0.899
198.4,205.6, so right now I'm a student seeing here and I graduate in about a month so I'm pretty excited,0.848
219.7,244.7, that's a good question I'm not really sure to be honest right now anything that where I could travel I know I want to travel be able to work with students and I really enjoy talking to people so some sort of job that combines all three of those I think would be the best job I'm just not sure what it is quite yet I love all those components so something along those lines would be my dream job,0.909
253.3,266.3, I think it depends on the situation I would I used to say outgoing but I think I've been more introverted in the last few years so it just kind of depends what I'm doing so hard to say honestly,0.913
273.6,275.2, again because it depends on the situation,0.909
283.8,310.4, that's good I just visited my brother Nick he lives in San Francisco I visited him but three weeks ago spring break and so that was really nice and then I called my mom yesterday I talked to my parents and I feel overall we have a fairly good relationship and they're really great I'm the oldest of three no oldest of four kids and then I have two younger brothers and a younger sister,0.913
319.9,330.7, I would say probably hiking or hanging out with friends or spending time with my fiance or excuse me um,0.87
332.1,338.5, or traveling I love traveling again so if I can get a quick weekend trip in somewhere and I mean that's just the best,0.779
347.5,376.3, I think I'm pretty good actually I think for me when I get upset I tend to process things over a period of time anyway so I don't I feel like I'm pretty convinced like I have a lot of self-control in that regard I think the only thing where I show more of a temper is when I feel like my friends are being threatened so I feel like I have more of like a mama bear kind of mentality where it's like if you're being mean to a friend of mine or two,0.878
376.5,389, my friend poorly then I think that's when I'm more quickly to kind of react right away just because I feel like that's really unfair so yeah I think I have more of that kind of like maternal protective kind of personality,0.816
401.3,416.5, good question I think is probably my fiance because we live with each other so I think maybe it was over like dishes or something I mean something really little yeah I think that's probably was it,0.826
432.5,461.6, I think that I mean let's go back to that that fight because it's at the Forefront of my mind right now anyway I think just trying to anticipate because like he's in school right now too and I'm in school and so I think we're both just stressed out individuals at the moment so I think going back and really trying to like anticipate you know how to make his life easier and trying to help out more even though I'm stressed out to like just kind of realizing like okay let's kind of,0.832
461.8,467.8, are the household responsibilities a little bit more so yeah I think that's something I would do differently,0.838
469.1,470.6, I think that was your question anyway,0.859
485.2,505, my friend just had her birthday over the weekend and so obviously I wanted to get her a gift for her birthday and I feel a little guilty I waited to the last minute to get something because I was kind of rushed and so I wish I'd put a little bit more thought into it so probably that comes to my mind first so,0.873
525.4,554.7, I think right now choosing a career is the hardest decision just because I really don't know I don't want to make the wrong choice and so like I'm trying to decide what to do and so that that's pretty much up there right now because I think once you commit especially to like a graduate school program I feel like you're really once you're in it I feel like you kind of need to follow that and even yeah you can always change career directions but I think once you've invested the time and the money it's hard to like really,0.879
555.8,563.7, rationalized changing it and kind of almost not like almost completely starting over so I think that's just a really hard decision in general,0.771
582.6,612.2, gosh that's a hard one I think for me I regret not taking because I'm a senior right now and I regret not taking more advantage of the career opportunity like the way to kind of explore different careers like my first and second year here like for like freshman year sophomore year and the guy was so focused on getting involved like clubs and organizations and and and those sort of things that I mean look great over always being a well-rounded person but I,0.868
612.4,635.7, like career-wise I didn't really give myself an option to explore other things I always kind of have like one dead dead set path now that I realize I don't really necessarily want to go down that path I'm kind of unsure of what to do because that is just kind of been my direction for so long so I think just like keeping an open mind probably would have been and I didn't do that I think is my biggest regret,0.78
649.6,652.9, that's a good one too God give me a sec I'm not sure,0.816
657.5,681.8, probably any like big fights I think with like family and friends because they're just not pleasant to look back on I mean though you also kind of learn from those experiences so it's kind of hard to say because I'm sure like I'm a different person now because of those experiences but yeah just I mean any big negative event I don't think anyone really wants to remember,0.909
692.1,692.5, no,0.892
704.4,732.3, good I would say really pretty tent I mean good but tents and kind of stressed out in that regard because again I just think like I'm about to graduate and like the career as a little bit Straight Like That figuring that holding out a little stressful so it'll I don't know I feel like once I have a directional it won't be like that but so I'd say right now I'm I'm I'm,0.785
732.6,736.4, I would but I'm tense and a little stressed and kind of anxious,0.895
745.2,745.8, no,0.878
753.4,758.3, they haven't really changed so no I feel like it's pretty pretty consistent,0.86
767.8,796.7, I would say it depends on how tired I am it's tough because like so my job so like I work as a flight attendant so my jaw like outside of school also being a student so my job is very much inconsistent when it comes to sleep hours and my sleep schedule so I'm working you know graveyard shifts I'm working red eyes and then I switched to work in early morning shift then I have a day shift and then back to the red-eye shift so like I just think my sleep patterns all over the place,0.826
796.9,801.8, they don't have a normal one and the time zone change to so that's kind of intense,0.808
811.2,811.9, tired,0.801
821.6,824.8, yeah of course I mean I'm a Psychology major so of course I believe in that,0.882
833,836.7, I mean Studies have shown especially like different therapies can help patients,0.879
847.2,853.4, probably probably just too,0.799
855.7,878.2, I don't know maybe probably in high school honestly to work really hard on the PSAT honestly because I was a lot of friends that got half rides to USC because it's so well on the PSAT and I just kind of didn't really think much of it so yeah probably that just study harder in high school so you can get better grades you can get more scholarship so you have less student loans,0.733
897.8,918.9, I've really enjoyed traveling so I had my last like big trip was to New Zealand and that was just an amazing experience it's beautiful there and so like I was just so so happy to be there in this gorgeous place and I felt so lucky so I'd say probably that was just a really great great feeling,0.907
932.7,952, I would say well obviously my fiance jde if he wasn't I wouldn't be with him but and then my best friend Grace they both to me are definitely very positive influence on my life which is why I keep him around so,0.911
961,985, I think she would describe me as very nice understanding very like I'll go out of my way to help others and recently she described me as chill I don't think I'm chill because I'm a little bit more anxious and that regard but like she's said that I'm very go with the flow so I think that's probably the term she would use,0.886
996.7,1017.3, this weekend I went to the California Disney California Adventure like Food and Wine Festival which I it was my first time going and it was so much fun I don't want to get my friend for her birthday and we just had a blast like eating and drinking and talking and just going on rides and hanging out the whole day it was it was so much fun,0.801
1027.1,1047.4, I think I'm really proud of the fact that I'm graduating and that I've worked really hard in order to be able to do that because I took some time off and now that I'm back in school again to graduate I'm very very proud of myself because it's hard coming back,0.831
1057.1,1057.8, you're welcome,0.862
1057.1,1057.8, you're welcome,0.862
