34.3,45.8, I'm okay it's been kind of a long day a little tired but pretty standard as far as Mondays go,0.881
55.5,65.9, I'm actually from Pasadena so really nearby from here but my parents are from South America further away but I was born and bred around here in SoCal,0.868
69.6,70.1, okay,0.832
73.2,97.7, Allah um I like the people a lot I like the variety of people I guess you could say I also really like all the things that there are to do around here there's definitely like all the museums and all the cultural events and that kind of thing I haven't seen it in any other city that I've been to so it's pretty cool to be here,0.796
102.5,105.7, hmm,0.882
107.9,137, I guess definitely like just the drug usage and that kind of thing in the area a lot of just the issues you know sexual assault and that kind of thing we hear about that a lot here and that's not obviously that's not okay it's something that like it just like yeah it's just not okay especially here in La La the figures are pretty high compared to anywhere else in the country so,0.909
137.6,139, that's a little concerning for me,0.85
151.3,176.9, yeah I used to when I was younger not so much anymore I have like two younger sisters so ever since they kind of joined the family it's been harder obviously financially for us to travel as much but I really enjoy traveling I've been all over the place have been to Hawaii have been New York mostly in the country haven't really traveled out of the country much with my family a couple school trips but that's kind of it,0.794
189.8,218.5, I guess I did go on a school trip to Guatemala that was definitely interesting it was like a lot of fun it was a group of people that I wasn't really that close to but it was still a really amazing experience I had never been there before I hadn't been to anywhere in South America before that actually so or Central America basically I had seen in the US as before that so it was really interesting to kind of,0.908
219.2,241.4, variants that and get to know the people there we had to go like across the lake a couple times and like a boat that was really interesting and just like it was so beautiful over there and especially living here in La where everything's kind of you know buildings typical stuff not so great like compared to that nature,0.912
250.5,266.2, not history for sure probably Science Biology was always really interesting to me but I was really good at math so for a while that was my favorite just because I was good at it but content-wise bio was up there,0.893
270.8,291.5, I am a psych in Spanish double major actually so yeah that's kind of and I like I work also I'm involved in a lot of things on campus and I have like a job over the summer that I'm going to be doing so I'm doing quite a few things,0.911
299.2,328.5,something that involves traveling for sure I do really enjoy traveling like I said it was kind of part of my growing up and that kind of thing but it's not something that I got to do much anymore I'm planning on studying abroad like that's kind of how I'm getting to that but I don't even I guess the actual job itself doesn't really matter to me as much as,0.837
329.3,337.3, the experience of traveling so something that lets me visit a lot of places and preferably that makes me a good amount of money that would be ideal,0.833
346,371.8, definitely outgoing like hands down I'm not really a shy person I've always been very like sociable very into talking to people it's part of why I like traveling so much you know getting to know different cultures and different people like a you know parties are in new situations of that kind of thing I'm always the kind of person who will walk up and talk to people I've never been like the introverted type that's just like every all those personality tests and that kind of thing that,0.893
372.1,376.6, make me taking that kind of thing always extroverted always out there willing to talk to people,0.761
383.8,413.8, I I don't know it's just it comes easily to me talking to people it comes easily to me it's something that I enjoy it's nice to hear about other people's experiences I think it helps me formulate what I want to do later kind of learning from their mistakes or like if they really enjoyed something kind of makes me want to do it more and just like being shy never really like I never saw a need to kind of suppress who I was it's more enjoyable to kind of,0.896
414.1,416.2, go out and do things and experience things,0.861
424.1,453.4, oh I love my family like hands down I'm such a family person part of it is just like my Hispanic roots and that's like one of our values but like hanging out with my parents I have a lot of fun memories with my uncles and my grandparents and of course with my little sisters I have three younger sisters and two of them one of them is 15 one of them is six and one of them is three so the two younger ones they're like like I could honestly,0.84
453.6,461.6, take care of them all day I go home in the weekends because I want to see them and spend time with them families are really big thing for me,0.831
471.6,496.9, honestly I play video games I know it's not exactly the most like stimulating thing in the world but it's something that I really enjoy I have a lot of fond memories doing that with my family when I was growing up so and it was something like my mom was really into video games my uncle's my dad so kind of like runs in the family I grew up doing it and it's just,0.882
497.1,514.8, it's enjoyable it's kind of gives me a break from like school all the time if I have an interesting book I really love reading to I grew up reading but honestly with the classes that I'm taking there's a lot of reading in there so it's nice to just kind of like back away from the books and do something different,0.876
523.3,552.7, it depends I'm generally a patient person I'd like to say I'm okay it you know waiting things through and kind of giving cutting people slack in that kind of thing but you know you get to the point where like sometimes if I'm having a bad day I do snap pretty easily and I recognize that and I know that's something that I need to work on but it's just like it things really affect me I think it's part of me being so like,0.806
553.1,578.7, added and tuned into other people's feelings as a result of that like something can kind of set me off pretty easily but I try to be as patient as I can honestly my temper is like I have a pretty long long string you know takes a lot of things for me to set me off but when I do it takes me a while to also get back onto like a stable mode again,0.852
589.7,612.8, honestly like I have pretty good have a pretty good relationship with my family and we've been going through some more personal things the past month or so but like generally is my relationship with my family's awesome my friends too but my roommate and I just don't really click well it's a lot of lot of like issues about my roommate bringing their girlfriend over,0.832
613.6,642.9, just like not letting me know and that kind of thing it's honestly really awkward situation and like that's when that's probably the last time I remember being like upset with someone and like actually like like Beyond just a discussion like a calm discussion it turns into this whole like big scale thing where I'm like look this isn't okay anymore and they're like why I don't understand why it's affecting you and it just it was a and it was,0.875
643,661.7, and of like I said like it takes me a while for me to get upset so it was kind of like a building up thing right it was coming up from the beginning of the semester it kept happening and then finally at the end of last semester it was just like finally just a full-blown like this is not okay anymore and I had been as patient as I could be up until that point,0.849
669.2,698.6,I think the situation that I just explained that one I mean honestly I thought I had handled it pretty well and at that point it was like what else was I supposed to do you know a situation I do wish I handled differently sometimes as my relationship with my oldest younger sister she's 15 and just like she thinks kind of affect her,0.891
699.1,725.8, um they like I'm very attuned to people's feelings but she's like me times a hundred so she's really tuned in to what people think of her and what how what kind of impression she's making she's really good at like nailing people when she sees them you know she like knows what kind of person they are and what makes them tick and just because of that she can tell when I'm off and when I'm bothered and if I react poorly to something that she's telling me she notices right away,0.793
728.2,757, and like she really takes it to heart even though in the moment I'm just like bothered you know or I'm upset and she really takes it personally so a lot of times later on like you know she's not doing so great or she thinks that I don't really like her or something like that and that's not true it's just because of how I was doing at that moment or because of how I was reacting at that time so yeah sometimes I wish I handled my relationship with her a little better and I just kept that in mind more,0.902
766.2,795.8, probably the same thing I just said honestly my my relationships with well that and also my relationship with my stepdad I guess they're in a way they're kind of linked my stepdad has always been I mean he's been around since I was like three years old so I really don't remember a time when he wasn't around but sometimes I feel like because like he's my stepdad and he's,0.889
796,805.3, the one who really works my mom stays at home to take care of my two youngest sisters and since I don't see him as much as specially now that I'm in college sometimes I feel like,0.912
806.6,836.2, I should be I mean I don't even know if it's treating him more as a parent because you know he is my parent and I don't have issues with saying that if someone asks like oh if someone asked me about my parents like I talk about my mom my dad and my stepdad right but sometimes it's like maybe I feel like I appreciated him more I showed that appreciation more I don't know if I'm really getting my point across with him that like he's done a lot for me and sometimes it's like maybe,0.888
836.4,837.9, don't show that as much as I should,0.863
860.3,861.4, yeah,0.885
862.7,892.3, actually I'm I don't know about like the hardest decision because I'm sure as soon as I walk out of here I'm gonna think of something but a pretty difficult decision one of the hardest decisions is probably choosing to come here to USC I was debating between due to different colleges and one was like my dream school and they had offered me financial aid but you know financial aid fluctuates depending on the year and then the other one was coming here and they had,0.913
892.5,922.3, for me a good scholarship here really good scholarship so making that decision was really difficult it was between like the the choice that like in my heart I really wanted to make and then the one that was like financially the better decision right like the reasonable decision that kind of thing and like I don't regret it right I love it here I love all the people I've met here I have a whole bunch of friends a really great and like I said I have like jobs on campus and that kind of thing I love my classes but that was definitely a,0.901
922.4,942.8, a really hard decision for me at the time and one that I like I was not happy with the decision that I made even though I knew that it was like the right choice to go to the school that was offering me more money it would be easier on my parents especially but that didn't really make it any easier on me like emotionally and like internally,0.745
954.4,959.4, I don't really regret that many things I feel like it's a,0.884
961,973.3, part of it is like you know what happens happens for a reason or that kind of thing I like having that kind of mentality or else I like I get stuck in the what ifs something I regret,0.881
976.3,976.8, I guess,0.754
979.6,1008.9, honestly I can't think of anything I straight-up regret I can think of more of like things that I'm curious about like what would have happened if I had chosen Claremont McKenna over you I see you know like how would I be doing over there wouldn't be too small of a campus for me he liked but I don't think it's necessarily A regret because I'm pretty happy with where we landed now the closest thing that I can get to regret is probably like again my relationship with my 15 year old sister like I really,0.789
1009,1034, I think that I could have treated her better as we were growing up so that our relationship right now wasn't so like unstable but even that you know we're getting better at it or working on it so like I regret that but also like it's getting better so it's kind of like a give-and-take type of thing you know it's,0.909
1036.5,1049, like I do regret it but I also recognize it at this point there's not really anything I can really do differently and regards to the past is just a means of like what can I do from here forward,0.844
1071.1,1095.3, I guess I guess the the relationship that I kind of had with my sister has always been kind of rough so something that I would definitely kind of I mean I assume like erasing by my memory in my memory is in like it just wouldn't have happened in the first place ideally my sister's been going through like a,0.892
1096.3,1120.9, she's going through a pretty rough time honestly and you know she has ADHD it's kind of hard for other people to kind of understand what she's going through and that kind of thing she was ADHD and anxiety and depression so it's just like a whole bunch of things I'll mix until like one one body and that's my sister so she's a she's a bit of a mess and definitely,0.882
1126.3,1128.4, she had to go into like this,0.875
1129.5,1158.9, into essentially what it was was a psychiatric ward right and like I completely strongly agree that she did not belong there by any means like she you know you see the other kids there and their kids who are there for a reason right and she was there for a reason right she had like written out this whole like it was just it was pretty bad I don't honestly I don't like to talk about it much it was tougher,0.878
1159.3,1188, and she was like talking about you know overdosing in that kind of thing it was really serious and I guess the entire experience of having to go she was only there for two days think God really a day and a half my parents got her out as soon as they were able to obviously they needed to go through the therapist in order for the therapist to like for the liability and stuff for her to be able to leave them to make sure that she was still stable and that kind of thing but,0.85
1189.3,1190.2, she,0.677
1191.8,1221.4, it was it was the experience of visiting her there for the first 24 hours you know there are no windows there of course there are no windows there's no exits she wasn't allowed in the cafeteria she wasn't allowed she was very limited because it was her first 24 hours there and they didn't know you know how well or how poorly she was doing so she was just like she was just she was in pieces really I've never seen her that bad so if possible,0.913
1221.5,1232.1, I would just take out that entire experience because she didn't deserve that it was really hard on my parents really hard on me yeah that was not not pleasant,0.865
1245.1,1251.9, no no and none of my family has either it's I mean not that not that I know of,0.821
1266.3,1293.9, honestly since that like I mean I've been okay I've been managing not as stressed as I'm also in the marching band right here at USC so last semester was just like wild constantly stressed my classes were a difficult but just managing everything was very difficult because classes on top of band on top of like being at a new University a lot of the friends that I made first semester weren't really,0.836
1295.2,1323.8, my type of friends they were all very into like drinking and smoking and that kind of thing and that's just I'm not into that at all so first semester was very hard on me so compared to that this semester has been really chill because it's not marching season and my classes I'm taking like social psych and you know stats and all my classes are pretty chill so like in regards to that I've been great actually and like I've met a lot of people through my classes,0.913
1325,1354.8, that are kind of more on my level that aren't into like smoking every single day but definitely like the whole incident with my sister that just happened a couple weeks ago so that was I mean it hasn't I mean at the time and for a couple days after that that was definitely on my mind and like I was managing okay because like I said my classes and stuff it's all pretty easy so it was very easy to,0.913
1355,1365.7, too kind of you know manage everything at once but I do think of my sister now and then and it's a little difficult to just like remember everything,0.706
1367.9,1382.4, but I just keep reminding myself like she's doing a lot better now she's safe she's at home she's with my parents so that's that's kind of how I calmed myself down so I kind of fluctuate but generally speaking I'm okay,0.891
1396.7,1419.7, honestly not not really um if anything it's like cutting more concern just for my parents and for my sister I know that the whole ordeal was like a lot on them but like I've always been a pretty steady kind of person so,0.734
1420.5,1442.2, with my my own thoughts and behavior have been pretty standard I mean compared to how I usually am so it's really more just like just more thinking about my family it's really more like concern for them it's not necessarily like thoughts about myself yeah,0.828
1454.6,1455.5, actually it's,0.741
1457.1,1484.1, it's pretty easy what so because I I play video games more the semester than I did last semester and like my friends are really into it we're all in the same classes and we're all you know pretty bright so we get through homework and stuff pretty early so if I'm feeling tired or whatever it's mostly because the night before I stayed up late playing Mario Kart not because I'm having issues falling asleep,0.775
1486.4,1515.6, but like in terms of actually falling asleep it's not difficult for me usually you know sit in bed kind of think about the day think about what's going on the next day and then before I know it I'm asleep definitely haven't been having like definitely have not had as many dreams as I usually do but I mean it happens sometimes or maybe I mean I'm sure I'm having them and I'm just not remembering them I should say so but pretty,0.913
1516.2,1520.5, it's not like I'm losing sleep or anything it's just it's normal,0.872
1528.2,1548.3, I get really like cranky it's like it's it's kind of rough my parents could always tell right away when I didn't sleep well I have a harder time focusing definitely a lot more irritable but like it's,0.771
1550.4,1575.7, I mean it's like I can still get through the day and I can still function all right throughout High School I functioned on like six six and a half hours of sleep which was nowhere near enough I need like at least 8 hours but like every night regularly six six and a half hours of sleep and I I pulled it off I can I so like I know I'm capable of doing it but it definitely is,0.83
1577.1,1600.4, like it's more of a chore to do everything it takes more of my energy which then makes me more tired and then I still don't get enough sleep the next night so it's kind of like this cycle but yeah I really especially now that I'm in college and kind of managing my own schedule I am definitely prioritizing sleep this semester and like it helps me a lot,0.909
1608.1,1637.7, yes absolutely I went to therapy for like I don't even know to three years I went for a while every week an hour hour and a half we did like family therapy for a bit well it wasn't really technically speaking it wasn't like family therapy but we did have sessions were like my mom and I would both be in there and my mom and my sister and I this was years ago you know when I was in like 8th 9th,0.893
1637.9,1640.6, eight like Middle School ish,0.747
1641.9,1671.5, probably like actually probably 8th grade through 10th grade actually or maybe 7th through 10th it was for a while basically and like it was just at the time you know there were times and I was like this is completely pointless and I don't really know what I'm doing here but looking back like it just helped me rationalize things a little better it helped me to have a place to talk to people to talk to,0.774
1671.7,1701.5, person I should say my therapist um it was definitely super useful and like I mean I really don't there shouldn't be a stigma around therapy honestly it's such a useful thing I think even if you don't have something like quote-unquote wrong with you which really like I have a whole other issue with that but like even if even if you're just like you know normal person kind of dealing with your daily stuff it's still nice to have someone to talk to someone who you,0.871
1701.6,1729.1, an kind of vent to and who can help you rationalize like what can you do from here like how can we manage your feelings better and like definitely going to therapy helped me like manage my anxiety a lot better and it was just and like it just it helped so much and I would say like there there should be no issues with people going to therapy no Stigma surrounding it because it helps so many people,0.736
1734.7,1762.9, I guess like I said it's good to have a place to like I guess vent or like talk through your feelings and talk through your day or week or whatever it's nice to have a space to do that with someone who knows how to handle it you know so that if you're having a particular like if you're struggling with something or if you have like this dilemma going on or something like that you have a,0.83
1763.1,1784.3, Ace and a person designated where they're like their sole job is just to help you manage and help you kind of manage things as well as you can and figure out like what strategies and stuff work for you so like Stress Management that was huge when I was going to therapy I was like constantly anxious and like I was honestly I was like,0.872
1785.8,1815.2, I was really anxious all the time so going there at least for my experiences and having like you know strategies that I could use in that kind of thing it was immensely helpful and I'm sure it is for anyone you know everyone gets anxious sometimes everyone feels a little nervous about something or some things overwhelming them and it's nice to have a place to kind of sit down and talk through that kind of thing and kind of help you manage your life a little better so that then when you don't have to go to therapy or any,0.799
1815.4,1823.2, or like you don't you don't want to I guess or something like that you have a better idea of how you want to manage yourself and your situation in the future,0.793
1835.8,1843.9, my guess is that this is because 10 years ago I honestly don't even know what I was like when I was 8 years old but it's,0.873
1848.4,1849.6, probably just,0.746
1851.3,1874.4, I actually I don't even know because I think everything that I went through and that I experienced has kind of helped me get to where I am right now I probably would have told myself to stress less and to just kind of and told myself like hey dad is going to be more manageable and even just like in three four years like he'll just because like I had a lot of issues with my dad,0.822
1876.5,1906.2, and just like having that kind of reassuring presence probably would have helped me or like knowing that I got through it and that I would be happier later on and that I would have like a really great relationship with my dad would be useful to hear at that age but at the same time like if I had known that maybe I wouldn't have liked put as much into my therapy sessions and then you know like I said like everything that happened in the past got me to where,0.862
1906.3,1921.6, I am today so probably some like reassuring like words of comfort that kind of thing just like it'll get better you'll be okay don't stress about it like this is coming from someone who literally went through it already and you'll be fine that probably would have been nice to hear,0.907
1935.5,1936.3, definitely,0.696
1939.9,1941.4, definitely over winter break,0.821
1945.4,1975.1, honestly like the first person that pops into my head is my boyfriend I absolutely love him he's like the best the best boyfriend I could ask for and you know everyone says that right but it's been almost two years in this dating and like I we have like an amazing relationship so probably sometimes he just comes over to hang out with me and my family and like watching him play with my two little sisters the the,0.78
1975.3,2004.1, old and the three-year-olds definitely a lot of fun and he's like really good with like engineering and Building Things so like he's really into Legos and then my two little sisters obviously they love playing with stuff so having him like build them things and then me like trying to trying to help him and not really helping him because I'm not really a crafty person or like a creative person in that sense so I mean,0.903
2005.2,2028, only my family is my home my boyfriend is definitely like a really big source of like comfort and security for me so anytime that I'm with both of them is when like I'm like in my Prime spot and especially over winter break where there's like no homework you could just be at home and like free of obligations that was definitely like one of the best than one of the best feelings,0.785
2033.3,2033.9, that's good,0.913
2036.7,2066.3,my mom for sure and I mean like I just said my boyfriend he's he's awesome like we work really well together he just he he kind of gets it his parents are also divorced he went to therapy for a couple years like we've had very similar experiences and we're like similar in our experiences but the way we kind of think through things,0.741
2066.5,2076.5, complement each other and it's just definitely a great influence but my Mom especially like I have so much respect for my mom my mom is like amazing she's,0.797
2077.8,2079.9, she's great she,0.822
2081.7,2111.2, she so she had me when she was young she was 24 both my parents were 24 and she like she went through all of her schooling she continued she was a she ended up being a clinical nurse specialist like while taking care of me and my sister and like being a mom she took all of her classes online she like studied until I don't even know what hours and then when she was a nurse she would do night shift and take care of us during the day I don't even know when she slept,0.796
2111.9,2141.4, um and just like seeing her and like even now she's still prioritized as my two younger sisters the youngest sisters you know and well she prioritizes all of his obviously but right now she's a stay-at-home mom and she's taking care of one of my younger sisters she has autism so my mom stays at home like totally prioritises the kids sheets them you know equally they're just in different situations than one,0.834
2141.6,2171.4, the stick one in the non-autistic one and of course my sister with ADHD and she does the best she can and she just she she worked hard she did what she needed to do she got things done and like she was top of her class amazing everyone that I've talked to who knows my mom is like oh I love Gabby like everyone loves my mom and like she's just she's amazing she's such a role model she's like I love my mom,0.769
2171.5,2179.6, so much I have so much respect for her so much you know she's she's awesome I could talk about her forever,0.684
2186.3,2215.9,so like I have my have a couple really really close friends I feel like has saying how my boyfriend would describe me would be a little biased so are you have my high school best friend who I've known since I was in first grade and been best friends with since I was in fifth and then I have my best friend here at USC he's awesome to so,0.837
2217.6,2220.3, I'd say the things that all three of them would probably say about me,0.832
