1,21.9,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment I'm not a therapist but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you I'll ask a few questions started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential okay,0.909
25.6,26.1, yes,0.813
33.4,41.6, I'm doing well I'm a little tired because I stayed up late last night but overall pretty good,0.752
47.6,48.8, Pensacola Florida,0.829
58.4,74, I really like the weather and kind of the ability to do multiple things in one city like my said he's pretty small so you're not really able to like go to downtown have that many like bookstores and different kind of cultural representations I guess and stuff,0.885
78.6,88.3, I like the traffic also like not having a car because I'm not willing to drive on the interstate,0.862
99.2,118.3, someone I would say for Thanksgiving I go see my aunt Seattle see my parents in Florida for Christmas and stuff but other than that during the school year I would travel for rowing so I went to like San Diego and San Francisco but nothing else,0.89
129.1,148.8, probably like getting my IB diploma I would say was pretty memorable because that kind of signified that all of my high school work was worth it and then that I knew I was coming to USC was like everything had paid off despite all the hard days long nights doing work like it meant something in the end,0.831
153.4,163.8, I really like to English but I'm studying science now so I guess that's kind of interesting,0.855
169.6,177.4, I study Neuroscience currently so kind of similar things to what you're working on is of interest to me,0.854
185.8,215.5, I would love to work for Nike like designing like maybe engineering some different Fabrics like incorporating some of their fabrics and two different designs and maybe they started doing some like hijab work I think they can expand to more cultural places get those influences in and put them in the designs that like anyone would,0.913
215.8,224.2, want to wear it when just be of a specific cultural group or space or time like it could live on,0.772
232.3,254.1, definitely more shy like I'm an introverted person and I need my time alone after being with a big group but I'm not like an apt at talking to people so I've good social skills outside but I'm just more shy and reserved till I come out of my shell takes you know a little bit of conversation,0.893
261,284.2, because I'm interested in what other people are saying I kind of want to hear who they are and their perspectives and beliefs before I kind of go on and give mine just to see if maybe we align or we disagree or kind of how to make the conversation flow smoothly so we don't kind of get in an argument but also it's a kind of I just,0.836
285.5,308, keep personal things to myself like only a few people know like a lot about me and then everyone else kind of knows a good amount but not like my personal hardcore like inner thoughts and you know they mostly just kind of know like I joke around and I'm pretty funny and you know silly in that kind of stuff,0.838
319,342.1, my family is pretty good we're I'd say decently close not well yeah I mean we're pretty close my brother now lives in Cincinnati so we don't really get to see him that often and he can only see us for a few days at a time because it works for the Reds so they have them on a pretty strict schedule but we,0.867
342.2,358, really close when we were kids but now as we've gotten older we have become closer and then my parents and I have a good relationship like we cook together every night and always eat dinner together and yeah so,0.903
359.4,366.7, remain in each other's lives I call them every weekend to to check on them or have them check on me while I'm here,0.82
373.8,393, I usually watch Netflix which I know isn't even that relaxing because you're still like engaged you know mentally so I would say definitely read I love to read so that would be kind of something that I do to relax and kind of calm down after a long day might make some tea,0.821
395.3,399.5, just lay down maybe take a nap kind of how I relax,0.889
406.8,435.7, I'd say pretty good honestly like if I do get mad about something I usually try and rationalize it and put it into a context or like if I'm mad at someone I'll say like oh well they've had a bad day or they've been getting in an argument with their family or you know things aren't going that well for them I can understand why they would take out their anger on me and cause me to you know get angry about something but I'm not violent or aggressive or anything,0.825
435.8,445.7, anything like if I have a temper I usually just internalize it and maybe cry later if it's that bad but that's it,0.888
457.9,480, argued with someone it's probably my roommate a few days ago she was seeing a guy and he broke it off kind of out of the blue and I was like you're going to find someone else it's going to be okay and she's like no I'm going to end up alone forever like I never should trust people I can't I can't do this you know,0.796
480.2,504.9, I keep getting my heart broken and I was arguing with her like you need to not be so negative you Nina look at the positive sides like you've always wanted to focus on your career you were doing that you had a bad relationship you were focusing on your career you were good then you pursue this boy like there's still opportunity you're still young and she was arguing like no it's over like I'm Giving Up So that's what we argued about,0.904
518,542.4, probably my roommate about this boy that she was saying that broke it off pretty abruptly and then she was saying she would end up alone and I was saying no you need to remain positive like there are upsides you know and she just couldn't see the upside she kept saying like no it's over I can't believe that I would even entrust myself to like someone like that was so stupid,0.903
542.6,559.7, bed and then she called her mom and her mom with like not on her side and did say it was her fault and so they were arguing more than my roommate and I had argued because we were just kind of on a basic level I was like you're not going to end up alone like it's going to be okay and it was just hard for her to see that at the moment,0.835
579.9,584.2,sorry please go on,0.85
588.1,589.2, what was the question again,0.86
599.3,605.4, please continue but I handled better or worse I guess better would probably be the question,0.889
608.7,638, when I argue with my parents sometimes I wish I handled it better there some arguments when I was younger with my mom that my dad would say just you know like a Pious her just say she's right and I'm so hard-headed like determined that I said no like I'm believe what I believe and that's kind of how I would play it out and also something recent with my roommate she had a,0.785
638.1,667.9, stir and she wasn't home one night and I let it out to run and it like escaped out of the ball and she was very very mad at me and I was looking like all day looking through all the drawers before she got home and I wanted to leave to how my friend cook dinner and my roommate was like no you haven't even found the hamster of course not like I don't want to be like this but you're the one that lost it like you need to find it and I was saying you can only find it in the dark like theirs,0.807
668.1,697.7, no point in me waiting around she's going to come out when she comes out and I do wish now that like I had told her the hamster was keeping me awake versus like blaming it on the hamster being Restless because then she took that as like a sign that she wasn't a good owner versus like I was just couldn't sleep because the hamster was awake versus like you didn't let her out like causing an argument from that so I wish I did handle that better and just was like it was,0.834
698.1,723.2, on me not on your hamster that everything happened and then also that I like just thumb through some drawers while she was there just to see her actively like have me looking versus her just seeing me laying in bed doing my homework in the complete pitch black waiting around for hamster run out for me to find her because I don't think she thought I was looking very hard then,0.889
736,764.9, okay so one night my roommate was gone so I put her hamster in the ball because the hamster was making a ton of noise like clawing biting at the side of the cage and it was 3 a.m. so obviously I couldn't even sleep at this point so I let out the hamster in the ball knowing like it was my roommates hamster not mine but like the hamster wanted to run I saw that it was fine and when I woke up she had escaped out of the ball my roommate still wasn't home but we couldn't find her,0.879
765.6,795.4, so that was kind of caused a lot of issues and then my roommate wanted me to find her which I completely understand and I was waiting in the dark for this hamster and my roommate didn't see me like looking through all the drawers and through everything you know so she didn't think that I was making much of an effort when I definitely was making a huge effort and I wish I had just kind of been upfront men like your hamster prevents me from sleeping versus like it was me that,0.835
795.5,807.5, couldn't sleep because of your hamster like I said oh your hamster was restless and that therefore she took it as like a personal attack instead of anything else so I do wish I handled that differently,0.822
820.7,848.2, I feel guilty that I'm injured and that like even biking sometimes like flares up my knee after like I just had knee surgery so kind of flares up my knee because I want to work out more and run and like jump and do all that but I'm unable to so I feel like I'm guilty because I'm eating maybe around the same amount that I would when I would work out every day but not,0.709
849.3,868, working out every day so it's clearly like affecting me physically and kind of a little mentally so I would say definitely feel guilty about not working out as much as I used to because I can't seem to find the time and I can't do as much as I could so it's kind of disheartening when I do,0.907
882.2,886.5, hardest decision I've ever had to make was probably,0.85
888.4,917.8, to leave the rowing team because I had formed such strong bonds with everyone that was on the team I was such good friends with everyone but I was injured so I couldn't participate very much and the coach was honestly very mad at me about the fact that I couldn't run the fact that I couldn't do some of our workouts that he wanted us to do and that I had to revise my workout plans due to the injury and he didn't even believe I,0.858
918.1,925.7, an injury so then he started to treat me differently and I kind of knew something was going to happen and then you said like I think you should leave the team,0.866
926.9,955.8, because we you're injured we don't really have a place for you you can't do the activities you know anymore you can't do all the workouts and so that was just a really tough decision coming to accept the fact that that had happened after all my hard work the year before and that current semester working through pain after pain day after day you know for him to be like I think you should leave and me kind of accepting that decision so,0.91
964.9,994.5, when I was a kid I broke my brother's finger or maybe like two fingers the night before his piano recital and I definitely regret that because you know he clearly had something involved and I once I was an angry or aggressive child I was definitely very loving but he is older,0.874
994.7,997, and I have just always been like,0.816
998.4,1024.5, more assertive than he has so I could boss him around and stuff and I guess that was kind of something that happened we were just playing around and it was the night before his recital and I didn't even didn't really know I guess or didn't remember but now looking back as an adult I am like okay yeah I definitely regret doing that that was that was a rude move very inconsiderate,0.889
1038.3,1067.8, I would say I told one of my friends that I had feelings for them and it didn't turn out very well and we were very very close friends so it kind of ruined the friendship and now like two months later we're still trying to rebuild the Friendship so I would definitely say that is something I just wish I could have raised and they could erase so we could just move on because it's clearly really affected how we interact around each other and kind of our,0.905
1068.1,1081.3, for the whole and that was never my intention and so I do really regret that and wish that I could just go away because I miss what we had before that happened,0.771
1091.5,1091.8, no,0.785
1103,1129.5, I've been feeling pretty good just tired honestly I'm staying up pretty late doing homework I used to set a time like 9 p.m. is when I become an efficient like I'm just gonna start to wind down my brain and nine but now recently because I'm taking six classes it's like 11 when I have to wind down and it still takes me two or three hours so then I'm going to bed at like 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. because my brains just so active so,0.799
1129.7,1157.3, I'm just pretty exhausted and I'm not getting in the Naps that I used to I used to take like a nap a day but now I don't have that kind of time so kind of managing my sleep schedule but other than that I mean I'm feeling pretty invigorated like I'm learning a lot I'm having the time in school so there's definitely a positive so that's kind of the general tiredness is what I would say is kind of affecting me most,0.841
1167.4,1167.7, easy,0.509
1171.2,1199.7, no I wouldn't say so everything is actually been doing pretty good usually I'm kind of anxious and I still am but I mean I think I'm kind of figuring things out as I go like I just joined a new organization so kind of befriending people and opening up and kind of having this large group that I know like everyone's a brother and has your back is kind of helping me relieve some anxiety like knowing if I have trouble,0.852
1199.8,1218, the class someone will be like yeah I can tutor you in specific you know this module or this or this you know knowing that people believe in more people believe in me and that I'm kind of gaining more friends outside of just my rowing Circle and like from my labs and stuff is really gratifying,0.849
1228.7,1229.1, um,0.881
1230.8,1260.3, once I fall asleep I typically stay asleep it's just I'm used to like having a fan being nice and cool when I sleep so sometimes I wake up because I'm too hot and then it's really hard to fall asleep but if I get to sleep and I can stay asleep then I'm good the entire night but I would say it's kind of of medium difficulty to get a good night's sleep so I've been taking some cortisol I think pills to like help me,0.881
1260.5,1268, sleep and they're all natural and just kind of accelerate the process of going to sleep,0.882
1277.3,1306.7, I would just say kind of maybe a little more nervous or once I angry or irritable like I keep my emotions in check a lot of the time because you never know how someone else is feeling so you can't just lash out at everyone and you can't just say nothing to everyone you have to realize when the situation calls for behaving a certain way or not and it depends on the closeness you have with whoever you're talking to so,0.911
1306.9,1335.1, say usually if I'm just tired I'm just extra tired by the time that I get done with however many classes I have in a day whether it's like 4 or 2 plus meetings or you know working out or whatever like eventually I'll just wear myself out again and go to sleep but there's not anything I can assess that like when I'm more tired I tend to behave in a certain way because I'm usually pretty stable,0.862
1343.2,1346.1, yes,0.865
1353,1374.8, I believe it's useful because it gives you an outlet to talk to a trained professional about your thoughts and feelings and they can do something like refer you to a psychiatrist get medicated if it's you know at that level or if you qualify on some point to you know have a diagnosis but at the same time,0.824
1376,1405.6, diagnosis but at the same time like even if you don't have any mental health issues it's good to just talk out your life with someone and kind of get an objective view of someone that's not a friend of yours or a family member that is hearing about people from your perspective so you can kind of maybe validate what they're feeling but also rebuked it if it's something like very bad behavior can be like well,0.873
1406,1419.6, you know I don't know how blank would feel about you you know lashing out at them all the time whatever kind of help you out better relationships with people and then he is tension off of your own Shoulders by talking it out with someone at the same time,0.847
1429.5,1459.2, okay well 10 years ago is nine twenty years ago I was Zero I was in the womb so I would say 10 years ago I would probably just tell myself it doesn't really matter what other people think I was nine years old I mean it's probably in fourth grade I would say maybe don't get so consumed And the fact I can't remember her,0.816
1459.4,1489.2, what grade I was in doesn't really matter Duncan get some consumed in the fact that like everyone's liking someone and then you like someone and you're so invested in this like potential relationship that could happen when you're nine years old like focus on yourself your own well-being and education and like learning as much as you can and playing the sports that you love and doing what you love and you'll find the right people and friends from that don't,0.913
1489.3,1514.1, don't you know try and appease people that you're just not going to get along with or that are just not going to like you because some people just don't like you and to accept that early versus like getting older and peeling why don't people like me like now I don't really worry about that if you like me you like me if you don't that's fine like we don't have to be friends we can just know each other and so I would definitely say that to my nine-year-old so,0.776
1519.4,1520.2, I see what you mean,0.913
1530.7,1553.8, good question I mean I'm a generally happy person but I'd say every time I faced I my parents they show me like how my cats are doing how my rabbits are doing so that makes me genuinely feel so good to just see them know they're doing okay and that I miss them so much but I get to see them so I guess in relation to that like over Christmas break I was really happy because,0.911
1555,1584, one like School hadn't started back up to I was applying to a program so I was like doing a lot of creative artistic Ventures that like I didn't have a chance to do earlier because I am a science major so that's just not what we do and same time like over this break I had my knee surgery so I felt a lot better after that I knew wasn't hurting anymore and then plus like I had my animal I got to see them and hold them every day and just,0.908
1584.5,1600.9, love them and now I'm back at school so just kind of seeing them through a screen has to be enough but just being back at work and like hanging out with my boss and stuff so definitely over Christmas break I was really really happy because got to kind of get back to my normal life like that I had before,0.835
1602.1,1631.5, school started in the summer and kind of just being with my family and making new recipes and stuff and not having to live alone or I had like pretty bad roommates my freshman year so I think that really negatively affected me and it was really rejuvenating to go home so it's I was really happy and rejuvenated to come home for winter break after everything had happened with a team and my friends and stuff so it's good to just get back to my roots,0.91
1635.9,1636.9, that's great,0.913
1640.4,1642.7, there's someone that's been a positive influence in their life,0.792
1644.5,1673.7, I'll post my family has always believed in me I would say I started a job in May 2017 and my boss ends then we've really gotten along unlike the daughter that she didn't have even though there are other employees like they don't get along as well or it's like a different relationship I don't know so my boss has definitely been a really positive influence in my life she's believed in me and like I text her about just buying business formal the other day,0.824
1674.2,1703.9, she like recommended some good websites just like Lululemon sometimes comes out with stuff like she knows who I am and what I'm like and like how to further myself like when I left for fall semester she was like you've really blossomed like working here you were kind of really shy the beginning and it was okay but you've really come into your own and like really form some really strong relationships with the clients because I work at a cryotherapy place,0.812
1704.3,1727.4, so just kind of establishing a rapport and building good relationships with my clients but then my boss is always been there and if I'm sick she was like stay home like after my knee surgery she wouldn't let me work even though I really wanted to work because she's like you need a recover like she understands who I am and what I'm about and we just get along really well,0.816
1728.8,1736.7, that's someone aside from my parents it's like always been in my life this is someone that's like recently been in my life and then we've gotten close from that,0.864
1746.1,1746.9, good question,0.803
1748.2,1763.9, I would say probably pretty funny would be a top one and then understanding like if someone calls me at four am all go to their room and talk to them for you know how real long it is to talk them down and pretty caring,0.815
1765.3,1766.6, and considerate,0.729
1768.7,1771.3, like a hard worker determined,0.876
1773.4,1782.3, just I feel like I'm pretty unique I don't really meet a lot of people like myself so it would be interesting to kind of see what my friends say about me,0.913
1783.7,1789.1, but that's kind of how I would think based on our experiences together,0.882
1798.7,1827.4, recently yesterday I got accepted like pinned into the service fraternity here to be a pledge and yesterday they took us to In and Out in Westwood and we were all like decked out and USC gear and just ate in and out and I love in and out so much that that was really really enjoyable and then just kind of getting to know some of the people in the fraternity better,0.872
1827.6,1855.3, and like having people kind of get what I'm about more because with a new group of like a hundred and thirty people now to meet and get to know it feels overwhelming and like a lot of names to remember and life stories to remember so it was good to just kind of sit down and get to know some people better and kind of feel out the Vibes and potential like closer friendships or you know what was going to emerge from it so that was a really nice experience,0.822
1865.5,1882.1, and my life I'm most proud of probably anything I don't really have regrets about anything that I've done,0.881
1883.5,1886.4, so everything that I've done has led up to this moment,0.887
