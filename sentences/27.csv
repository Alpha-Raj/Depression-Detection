516.8,534.1, two of us we Bates told me that like I had I had it done anything wrong and I didn't believe that I had to have anything wrong so like I guess it was like a one-sided argument but I just like got really hurt and I guess we like got into a fight about it and now I'm like pretty okay with like not being friends with hope so that's fun,0.803
551.8,571.4, of in sixth grade I lost one of my best friends because I don't even remember what happened but I just remembered that I was being bitchy and she was being bitchy and like I just took it a step too far because I again sometimes like don't think when I act so I think that that,0.765
