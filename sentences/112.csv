94.3,119.4, well I don't really like the security of La cuz in my hometown there's a much less homeless people or hobos so I feel like there's a lot more homeless people in LA and the street just look a bit messy and dirtier,0.898

326.9,351.5, I think it depends on the people I'm talking to so what I'm talking talking to a stranger I don't consider myself to be a shy person I'm kind of outgoing and I can get along with people very very well in short amount of time but if I'm talking to someone of professionals or someone of I don't know how else to higher status for me,0.857
351.7,355.4, then I would probably be more introverted introverted,0.845
361.5,390.9, well I think it's it's because that the people who I'm talking to is having more knowledge or have more experience for me and so I have more respect towards them and that's why I might feel a little bit closed of myself when I'm talking to them I think that's why I behaved more shy when I'm talking to people of,0.91
391.9,392.8, of professional,0.719
400.2,409.2, my relationship with my family is so I live in some of my my family is,0.866
410.2,439.9, I think I am not very connected with my family basically because I went to school that I went to a boarding school so I didn't really have time to spend time with my family during weekdays and during weekends even though I went home I I'm I don't really like interact with my family a lot there's only during the time when we have Vacations or holidays that I can,0.878
440,467.6, be able to talk to them and have to have have meals with them and now now I'm even less connected with them because I'm in I'm in America and they're back in Shanghai so I don't feel like I connect I'm connected and I am connected with them a lot our interactions this most common most mostly from like,0.894

498,501.6, and I also do some sports to relax myself,0.876
508.8,537.9, I think I'm pretty well a controlling my temper because I don't want to behave as if I'm out of control in front of people so if I'm if I'm at with somebody I don't feel like I will get it out quickly get it out in front of in front of that person I feel like I'm more intended to control my temper,0.872
538.8,542.8, and and just hide my anger towards him or her,0.89
552,581.5, I really can't remember the last time I argue with someone because I I I don't really argue with people let me think I think the last time I argue with someone so it's when it's when a person we so we had we so this is the time this is the time when me and my friends plan to go out to have to have dinner,0.829
582.1,611, and and this and this person she just she just suddenly decided not to go and without any any prior notice notifications so and he and she and she just said I'm not going and and she didn't get didn't give us any reasons so since I'm the one who planned this this dinner at it's because the purpose of this,0.91
611.6,641.5, this dinner is that is we have me and my friends haven't been meeting for like half a year so I want to meet them and we want to have a good time but she just suddenly says she's not going and that kind of get me irritated I didn't have argument with her like face-to-face but I just told her on social media on on through mess,0.913
641.8,660.6, messaging that I'm kind of upset with what you just said and if you are really not going at least give me a reason that that that proves that you are not available at that time yeah,0.775
672.4,701.4, situation oh okay I remember that at one time I was I was doing my assignments from from from from what one of my courses and I'm just really really stressful because there's so many midterms and assignments due around that time and I and I just got really irritated in,0.856
701.5,726.1, my friend I didn't have argument with anyone any of my friend but I just got upset and I think I behaved as if I'm really angry I think that's one of the situation I wish to handle differently I wish that I could handle my my emotion and be more calmed,0.911
727.1,745.3, under that circumstances and I think it's getting better now because because I'm trying to control my negative emotions more frequently now when I'm interacting and communicating with other people's,0.898
760.7,770.3, I I don't really think I have something that I'm guilty about if if there's one thing I think,0.828
772.5,802.1, I think I'm guilty about that I didn't really communicate well with my with my family because I know because I know they really care about me but I just really didn't get a chance to talk to them that much especially my grandma because she's she's living living with my grandpa and the and then and they and they I think they kind of live,0.814
802.3,814.5, lonely life and I know they care about me but I just didn't get a chance to really talk to them that much yeah that's the thing I feel guilty about,0.901
831.7,835.7, I think oh I think the hardest decision,0.791
837.4,865.9, it's when it's when I'm um I'm applying to high school and I was originally admitted by one high school and because at the time I didn't read the school policy strictly I didn't really carefully read the school policy at that time I think I was like bind it to that school and I can't like I can't,0.864
867.7,880.8, I just can't go to other other high school but at that time I'm really not have not decided that I just want to go to and going to go to that school and,0.809
882.3,911.6, by the time I know that I have to go to this school I think I changed my mind and because it was that the education system in my country which is different from like the the other foreign foreign or International School in China so I made this made a decision to to to retrieve my my,0.86
912.2,937.6, the my status as a student in China 2 and 2 to go to that international school so I eventually I didn't go to this Chinese high school which is under the Chinese education system I went to that International School in China and eventually I got here yeah I think that's one of the hardest decision I've ever made,0.842
951,955.7, I think that I think I'm kind of freaked read about,0.913
958.5,974.5, not having a chance to really talk to my talk to my family I know I know they care about me very much but I just didn't really communicate them well yeah,0.901

1066.6,1068.8, I'm feeling pretty good actually,0.804
1082.2,1100.9, I think lately I think I'm changing from a really religious person to a somewhat to a somewhat less religious person because when I was in when I was back in China my family is really traditional and,0.848
1102.5,1127.1, my family is mostly a Christian family and I was really religious at that time but after I got here I just kind of I think I'm kind of forgetting about the religious tradition of that I adopted in my family and I'm getting more open-minded,0.904
1127.9,1129.2, with myself yeah,0.822
