1,3.4,hi thank you,0.81
26.2,26.8, yes,0.773
29.6,30, yes,0.908
33.6,34.1, yeah,0.725
41.1,42.5, good how are you doing,0.854
55.5,62.3, so I was born in South Korea but I was raised here in a smaller city called Rancho Palos Verdes send the South Bay,0.843
77,95.5, obviously I really like the weather you know and one other thing that I really love is the food here and the diverse City I was born in South Korea so I'm pretty used to the Korean food and Asian food and we have a lot of that in K-Town here so I really appreciate that,0.81
104,118.4, okay so I went to Indiana for one year for college and undergrad and compared to that what I really hate here is the traffic it's always packed and it takes forever to get anywhere so,0.902
134.7,150.7, the only places I really travel to the only times are when I travel back home to South Korea so I like to go to Korea and back maybe once once a year or two so yeah that's the only times I travel,0.832
160.3,188.4, well traveling is always fun because I mean this world is huge and we only have so much time to look at the go around and look at the entire world and even though South Korea is this is such a small country you know it II visited maybe once or twice in one year or two and I still haven't gotten around the whole country yet so yeah I like to go,0.877
188.6,193.5, to new places meet new people try out new food so yeah,0.756
201.3,230.8, mmm so I this is not really a trip but in Korea Korean citizens are required to enter the military but I am not a Korean citizen but I actually volunteered so it was more it was that you like a two-year trip to the military so I got to meet a lot that was my first time staying in Korea for that long so I really got to explore the Korean culture that I,0.764
231,259.3, had not had had the chance to explore when I was born there so I really appreciated staying there for two years getting to know my relatives as well so yeah that's when I really got to know Korea my hometown and gotten to meet some meet some really cool people there so yeah I really appreciate it that time in Korea,0.885
270.6,299.7, so in Korea playing computer games is is like their own they have their own culture of doing that here growing up I use I grew up playing in playgrounds or playing sports or going to the beach and things like that but in Korea a lot of these guys they just go to those PC cafes where it's the whole place is full of computers and you can go in and just play games for as long as you want it's super cheap probably like 50 cents per,0.754
299.9,328, our so one time I went with my friends that I met over there and just stay there for like almost 20 hours and I am not really a fan of playing games but I had that was really fun because in there you can order food in there you can order coffee they basically give you everything in there and you just play games for 24 hours 20 hours so that was a new experience but it was I had a lot of fun,0.817
340.7,363.2, that's a really good question you know in high school my favorite subject was actually English just because I wasn't really interested in studying but I had a really good teacher who she was hilarious and she liked their students so that was my favorite subject in high school but coming up to college,0.785
363.3,391.3, - I think math was actually my favorite subject because it really took me into another space when I when I'm working on these problems I don't know II don't I don't know that I don't constantly check the clock time goes by really quickly and I don't I really don't stand up until I solve that problem it's it gets me super focused so I really enjoy solving math problems,0.76
400.3,427.9, well right now I am a full-time student undergrad student at USC I transfer from Indiana University to USC studying business with a minor in Information Technology but my career interests are it's in Consulting so I am I'm actually preparing for my internship my upcoming internship in the summer so right now just going to school and preparing for the internship,0.754
436.2,465.8,okay my dream job would be ultimately reason I'm going into Consulting is because later down the line I want to have my own company and I like to have a control over my actions and I like I also like to have that freedom and flexibility for myself as well as the people that are working,0.836
466,474.3, Army so ultimately down the line I would like to have my own either Tech firm or other business,0.781
485.7,509.3, I think that really depends when I was younger I was more of a shy person but now I feel like I've kind of developed that switch to when I need to speak up in front of people or when I need to go to a networking event be a little more expressive than I turn on my I turn off my shy switch but in,0.879
509.5,513.6, cases I do tend to be a little bit shy,0.833
523.9,551.4, I'm not sure I never really thought about it growing up I owe I kind of like to be left alone and that does is that's not to say that I didn't I didn't talk to my friends a lot or anything like that but I like to have a really small group of people who work who I'm really close with I didn't really like to go out and party or go out drinking and meet a lot of new people,0.913
551.5,578.9, but I found joy in doing that growing up so that's why I like to travel now because I get to meet a lot of new people and I think it depends it's all it all comes down to experience and um you know the having having different experience Growing Up made me realize that it's not all about the people around you the world is a lot bigger than that so yeah,0.909
586.1,612.7, well I'd like to think of my family as the best family in the world we are extremely funny when we're together we care about each other but I my dad actually stayed in Korea when the rest of our family moved to the United States so we have I have that soft spot for my father because he's lived kind of separately from,0.913
612.8,638.7, the rest of his family so that's why we I have that soft spot for him and also my brother and I actually left South Korea together first and then rest of the family followed alone so I also think of my brother as a partner and a mentor to me so yeah I have a really good relationship with my family and we're happy,0.901
648.4,674.5, I actually like to meditate I like to read books sleeping helps but I think II learned to meditate when I was studying back in Indiana because I Was preparing to transfer to to USC and and that's when I was kind of anxious and I needed a way to release,0.8
674.7,679.4, my anxieties and so I think meditation is a really good way to do that,0.837
689.7,717.3, I think I'm pretty good at controlling my temper and obviously in middle school and high school going through puberty I don't like to talk about this but I think I had some anger issues I don't know for some reason I was always angry but I think now I've learned to not only just not be angry but also learn to kind of release,0.907
717.6,733.6, my anger in a positive way so you know using converting that negative energy into positive energy by doing some bun and activity like playing sports playing sports reading or meditating so,0.884
747.7,775.3, I actually don't like to argue but I do argue with my family once in awhile I I believe the last time I argued was about my younger brothers College the admission decision and it was about like my younger brother was trying to decide between some other school and Pepperdine University,0.744
775.5,797.5, I was trying to explain why Pepperdine would be a better option because the other school was public and I'm not a huge fan of public education for various reasons that I won't talk about now but so yeah that was I was having an argument argument with my mom because she preferred the public school to Pepperdine University,0.821
812.9,813.3, hmm,0.726
818.1,845.6, I was in in Korean military I was actually the squad leader of eight members and you know that was the very first leadership position that I've ever taken and so I was very new to this you know to having to lead other people and in the Korean military there's all kinds of people there is people who are way older than me there's people who were from like who are you who were gang members,0.743
845.7,875.5, before they came in there were people who were like Highschool graduates or middle school graduates like they are uneducated people so I think I was really kind of scared to tell people what to do so I started off kind of being I started a little bit slow and not being able to control my team very well in the beginning and later later I learned that these guys are all the same,0.802
875.7,896.7, people in the military they're not they're not gang members in here they're not there's no such thing as you know older or younger the military so I think what I wish I would have done differently is to be able to take control of my position and look at the situation rationally rather than emotionally or personally so,0.909
905,908, nope that was it next question please,0.875
919.6,948.5, one thing about I always feel guilty about is not not not being able to see my father very often because we grew up in the United States while he stayed in Korea working and I know that I know that a lot of international students and going through the same thing but for me I just feel guilty that because of our efforts,0.797
948.7,977.4, caishen my father had to sacrifice years and years of alone time and so that's that's kind of a Burden Burden that I have not just me but other than my siblings as well they feel the same way and I hope I hope after college after graduating after stabilizing I hope I can visit South Korea more I can see my father Moore and,0.75
978.6,981.3, and yeah that's that's what I feel guilty about,0.773
1014.7,1040.4, I don't think there's actually anything I regret even though when other people look at it look at what I've been through they probably think that I have a lot to regret because in high school I didn't study you know I spent time just playing with my friends not really doing any school work I barely got into college Indiana University I,0.908
1041.2,1069.8, I volunteer for the Korean military which in the Korean in Korea people try to avoid the military because it's mandatory so all these things a lot of people think that I would regret those but you know me when I make decisions I always try to think what I regret this few years down the line and so I think because I always do do that there's not really anything I regret,0.82
1070.8,1077.6, the mistakes I've made I've improved on it so there's nothing really I regret at the moment,0.892
1107.8,1114, I was actually 20 I was I was 20 years old,0.86
1122.1,1147.9, well you know when I went to Indiana I was really not not very disciplined in terms of academic I wasn't really focused on studying I like to party a lot back then so I after my first year in Indiana I felt like I needed some way to and I needed a way to just get rid of all my habits existing habits and replace,0.897
1148.2,1167.4, with new fresh good ones and I thought you know what we're better to go than the military you know that when I go to the military I'm away from my family my friends everyone it's a new environment it's a good place to get a new fresh start and that's exactly what happened,0.909
1177.1,1205.5, you know a lot of people ask me that because it's a it's a two-year commitment is that unlike the US military the Korean male mandatory Korean military is two years and some people might think that it was a waste of time but for me it changed my life completely it taught a lot of good life lessons as well as good good habits that I still have,0.81
1206.4,1211.2, so I I think it was one of the one of the best decisions I've ever made,0.8
1225,1240.2, in fact we had like combat situation simulations like warts simulations but we I did not unfortunately or fortunately get to see an actual combat,0.817
1255.1,1284, it was it was not that hard I'm I you know after staying two for two years in the military I just couldn't wait to get out and when I was in there I was not doing any studying I was just doing a lot of physical labor and I really wanted when I was in there I really wanted to study use my brain a little bit so when I came out I just started began studying like I've never,0.784
1284.2,1297.1, done before so yeah Trent the transition itself was pretty easy because as soon as I got out I just started studying and yeah,0.905
1313.4,1342.2, so earlier I said that I transfer from Indiana to USC but in between actually I went to Indiana to the military and then I went to a community college for two years and then I went to USC so after I got out of the military I just started preparing to transfer and yeah for the two years after I got out of the military I just worked and studied and went to a community college,0.729
1343.6,1345, try to transfer to USC,0.805
1356.8,1386.4, like I said serving in the military gives you a lot of life lessons as well as good habits personally the most what I benefit where I benefited the most is developing that leadership skill I had the opportunity to serve as a squalid and that helped me that actually turned me around from a extremely,0.902
1386.9,1416.7, guarded and shy person to to a leader who's able to see speak up in front of people tell people what to do who's not afraid to take some risks and sacrifice myself for the team so these are all the values that I learned in the military not just as a leader but being in the military where if there's a worse situation we are all we're always expected to be able to sacrifice ourselves for each other or,0.754
1416.8,1424.5, the civilians so you know a lot of good mental habits that I learned so yeah,0.913
1436.4,1442.6, lately I've been very happy actually very happy,0.871
1452.9,1455.7, no I'm I think I'm the same,0.854
1463.7,1490.3, how easy is it for you I do have a little bit of trouble sleeping I usually roll it up Laura roll around on my bed for maybe maybe two hours before I could fall asleep so that has actually been an issue but other than that it's not too bad,0.869
1499.2,1523.8, if I don't sleep well I feel I can feel that the lack of energy the next day so you know when I when I feel that way I would try to get my energy back I don't know energy level back up with Caffee caffeinated drinks alike or Energy Drinks like monster or just coffee,0.904
1541.3,1545.4, I feel that there are p is useful,0.843
1546.7,1547.4, is useful,0.643
1558,1581.5, well I mean I think therapy would be useful personally if I was going through some mental breakdown or I was having some issues internally rather than externally or if there are things that's going on in my life that I can't really tell anyone I think that'd be going visiting a therapist and talking about it just talking about it would be really helpful,0.874
1594.1,1622.2, I would have told myself to to do the same thing but take more risks and play harder honestly because that that time doesn't come again and if you have Chan if you have chance to make a good memory make a good memory then take all the chances you need because that's not coming back down in your life and as you get older you're going to have,0.912
1622.3,1628.3, and less opportunities to do that so yeah take more risks and play harder,0.745
1643.5,1667.7, you know what I think that's when I got into USC for so for the two years before I got into USC all I was doing is studying and starting eating and sleeping you know I was so motivated and getting out of the military I just I was just full of motivation and Fire,0.906
1668.7,1669.3, and,0.812
1670.8,1686.7, for two years I just study straight and when I got that acceptance letter from USC I think that was when my emotions my emotion kind of turned like mice which kind of turned on so yeah I was happy,0.905
1698.5,1727.6, so I have my cousin in South Korea his name is ginny up so he's been kind of my mentor when I was in the military I contacted him a lot to hear his advice he's someone that I've always looked up to growing up you know he's very smart he's had no trouble going through his career path he's a very successful person he has a job,0.798
1728.4,1742.8, here's a very reputable job now and you know I think just hanging out with him a lot talking to him a lot it it made me more mature so he's been a really positive influence throughout that process,0.712
1751.8,1757.2, I think my best friend would describe me as funny but serious,0.88
1761.2,1762.8, but mostly funny and,0.861
1765.3,1768.3, not that serious honestly yep,0.83
