23,23.7,yeah,0.805
25.7,26.2, yes,0.909
36.8,45.2, I'm okay it's just having some back pain but other than that and schoolwork everything is fine,0.861
51.4,64.5, I was born and raised in Taiwan and I moved to the u.s. in 8th grade and I first lived in Boston for four years but then I moved to LA in my senior year of high school,0.748
72.6,102.6, I think just the weather and the people if remember back then in Boston people are not so friendly and you know as an immigrant when I first got there at home I barely speak in English so it was really hard to fit in but over time obviously had to survive so I began to pick up the language and also get to know the culture but then just overall didn't really had a good time,0.891
102.7,132.2, I'm there and somehow moving to California just everything just change I began to be more social and you know actually make friends that are like friends I can actually connect it to and just had a better life here and I would say I'm overall happier than the days I have in Boston besides the traffic and,0.778
132.6,143.1, you know the fact that you have to drive to anywhere that's what I would say other than that honestly everything's great,0.903
150.8,165.8, back then I do remember I'm back in Taiwan before I moved to the US my family will always you know go to places like Europe Japan every summer and winter but after we relocate we don't travel as much,0.798
172.6,194.6, if they did greatest thing about traveling images that opens your eyes you get to see different cultures and you know things you never seen before and it just makes you become a more compassionately person it makes you see things from different perspective and more understanding and less judgmental,0.792
203.2,217, the most recent trip I've made is to Europe with a group of Orchestra what we did is We Tour in I'd say four or five countries like Italy,0.831
221,248.2, and some I forgot some other countries like small European countries and we just play shows every two three nights and really just look around and just explore different parts of the world and it was great just hang out with my colleagues well we do life together and try the food we never have before and see the scenery we never seen before it was pretty rewarding,0.912
254.5,280, for the trip I would say there was this one night when we're playing our last show the concert master was she was goofing around before the show and you know when when the concert began her violin Was Out Of Tune and we're just waiting for her to tune her violin and it just slows the whole concert down it was embarrassing but then you know we still we still pull it through,0.826
280.9,288.1, yeah I think that was probably one of the highlights still makes me cringe till these days when I think of it,0.758
294.8,299, favorite subject I would say either,0.772
300.3,321, psychology music or history obviously psychology is my major so I have to be interested in to be major in it but other than that I really enjoy history courses and music because you know I do play music and my mom is a musician so that's always something that has been part of my life,0.827
327,335.3, I'm currently a student I'm a junior I am studying psychology and my goal is to become a psychiatrist someday,0.875
351.4,377.7, ideally I would like to be a musician and just to write music have my own band and just touring go around the world play my music and that would be probably the best alternative if I cannot become a doctor because playing shows it's always great and it's just something I really enjoy doing business,0.913
377.9,381.1, sites you know studying psychology,0.79
399.7,400.3, definitely,0.719
402,408.5, definitely a shy person and I think over the years just because,0.858
409.6,419.2, I've been moving up a lot just that whenever you're at a new environment you have to really put yourself out and get to know people so,0.767
421.5,450.2, just I'm more open these days but overall I would still say I'm a very shy person it's really hard for me to open up with people sometimes but once I get to know them it just become really easy especially when I become really comfortable with them I can just really be myself and disclose you know whether personal information or just something that's more like emotional and sensitive,0.91
458.3,484, I don't know I think it just may be the way I was brought up just that I transfer I went to a lot of like different switch schools I went to two Elementary School's two middle schools and three high schools and even after high school I went to Community College and now transfer to SC just that I've been over the place and you know the first semester,0.784
484.5,505.4, or the first month at a new environment was always challenging but over the years I kind of learn how to adapt and how to put myself out there when switching to a new environment so it's always challenging but I like to think it's getting better and better these days,0.905
514.7,536.7, so my dad actually left our family when we moved to the US so after that in eighth grade just me my mom and my older brother and and I'm not having a father figure growing up when you're in your teens it was very challenging but then now looking back it just,0.784
537.4,567, it's sometimes it's just really hard to imagine how I survived and how I got to where I am today and I'm really thankful that I have my mom and my brother just constantly looking after me even during the days when I left I dropped out of school my mom is still there pushing me helping me and my brother had just that always there and he's almost like a father figure to me so,0.805
568.1,573.3, I'm really close with my brother and my mom but not so much with my dad,0.877
579.5,602.2, usually I would just play guitar and I write music on my own other than that I will hang out with friends and and families to I really enjoy spending time with my family especially now in college you don't really get to see them so whenever I get to see them I would try to spend as much time as I can with them,0.851
610.6,611.2, so,0.736
612.6,640.5, I think the best way to control temperature just knowing that whoever you're mad at whoever you're frustrated with their humans to and everyone makes mistake the best way is to have compassion and you know have some Grace just knowing that I may be the one who is in his or her position someday and somebody's going to get mad at me but if I can,0.9
641.5,671.1, not be mad at them they would really appreciate my temper and hopefully they can learn this and treat others like the way I treated him someday even though at times super hard especially you know in college when you live in a dorm you just have a really dirty roommate or suitemate and it's hard to really open up and tell them that hey you're really dirty why don't you do your,0.89
671.2,695.3, wishes I don't dislike you but I really don't like what you're doing and just yeah I think just as you meet more people it kind of just it's a skill that you just built up and so far I would like to say I'm okay at it and there's always a space for improvement,0.699
711.2,740.8, I argue with someone was actually not like a direct confrontation but it was the actually the day before this semester began so over the winter break I got really close well yeah I got close with this girl I met from last semester we've been hanging out a lot over the break we you know,0.87
740.9,770.5, over the over the winter break we went bowling we went to movies and she even brought me to one of those live TV recordings in Sony studio in Culver City but then she never told me what I said that upset hurt and she just cut me off and you know obviously I was trying to figure out what I said that upset at her but she never replied to me and then we haven't been talking,0.889
770.9,771.7, ever since,0.65
784.9,808.1, honestly I don't know how I would react differently I I believe I've done everything that I could and this right so as soon as I learned that she is mad at me the first thing I did is I tried to call her and send her a message and just tell her that hey I heard that you're mad at me and I would like to meet you in person and,0.777
808.6,837.7, just discuss what are the things that I've said or done that really upset you and that that I did but then she never replied you know obviously I was trying to reach out to other mutual friends we have to see and learn what I actually did but you know despite knowing kind of knowing what I did to her not hearing from her edges,0.831
838.6,854.4, makes a very difficult and you know it just not so it doesn't feel like I really truly know what I did to her so I think I've done my part but since she doesn't want to reach out there is nothing I can do about it,0.781
865,868.2, things I feel guilty about well,0.858
871,873.8, I think one of the things I really feel guilty is that,0.857
878.3,902, when you know your parents are trying to they always want the best of you but then you know when you're younger you don't know anything and you think you know better and when they give you some advice but you just did the opposite and you know it breaks their heart and at the time you are aware of it but you're just so full of yourself,0.819
903,915.5, and now you look back you just realize how much of an inconsiderate irresponsible kit you are and it just makes me guilty when I look back and think of the instance,0.855
929.1,952.9, the heart is decision I've ever made a is in my junior year of high school when I decided to drop out from school just take a break I remember at the time I was diagnosed with ADHD and then I was prescribed with medication and just you know trying to focus in school because you know Juniors the time when you're prepping,0.811
953.1,982.8, for a SAT or act and try to look ahead for your future for college and just the time when schools are really overwhelming and I just find it very difficult to focus even though I've been having this issue since I entered elementary school but it just gets so overwhelming that I just decided to take a break and you know obviously before I did that I talked to my parents I talked to,0.776
983,1012.9, my brother and everyone seemed to be on the same boat they just told me that hey it's okay to take a break and I never regret my decision like now looking back I did take a break from high school but I still finish high school on time I didn't get to a university right graduating from high school but now I am at one of the top 30 universities so it's it's great I never regretted,0.858
1013.3,1042.8, and if I could change things if I can go back and change the way I do things I'd probably say I wouldn't do it because it just I learned so much about myself and just about life in general when I'm not in school so I think taking a break from school it's probably one of the best decision I've ever made in my life even though it's tough when you're not in,0.822
1043,1058.6, it's cool it's really lonely and people always question like where are you what are you doing and it's hard to be open with them and be honest with them on what is going on with your life but overall it's really worth it,0.87
1082.5,1086.3, something that I regret is that,0.863
1091.6,1118.2, I think something I regret as more like a continuous thing just whenever you finish something for example it's school project and Essay a relationship or any other things that you're doing just the fact that afterwards you look back and you realize that you didn't put in your effort you didn't try hard enough you didn't put in your full potential and like for example,0.772
1119.5,1120, that,0.888
1121.7,1150.8, when you when you when you're assigned to do something a project for instance you you're interested in your you're involved then there's other stuff other commitments you have to do and you just end up not putting your best and that's just one of the things that I always regret even though you know the result it's not always bad but you just the fact that you know that things can always get,0.759
1150.9,1166.2, better there's always a space for improvement and you knew that you're not putting your full effort that just one of the things I regret sometimes and it's just this constant struggle of knowing that you can do better but then you're not doing your best,0.804
1167.3,1168.2, so yeah,0.85
1176.9,1177.5, damn,0.831
1183.8,1185.7, I haven't said anything but,0.835
1190.9,1191.7, something,0.768
1192.9,1193.4, no,0.769
1197,1197.6, not real,0.701
1206.1,1215.8, not so good just having this back pain and they just makes walking very difficult but other than that,0.902
1217.6,1221, things are okay or at least appears to be okay,0.862
1230.3,1247.3, yes I do feel a lot happier this semester and I've been more social just trying to put myself out there began to be more involved in school clubs spend more time with friends and,0.905
1248.5,1254.3, I would say yeah I'm a lot happier than I was last month last year,0.798
1261.3,1289.8, it's very difficult so I've been having issues with sleeping since I moved to the states and you know I've tried to exercise I've tried different diet and you know sleep hygiene you know don't look at your phone don't engage in any exercise or work before sleep and obviously none of them really work I think I'm just it just my personality I'm,0.811
1290,1294.7, always anxious I'm always stressed and that's just something I have to work on,0.845
1301.2,1308.8, sleep and just try to go through the day and you know coffee always help,0.893
1318.8,1321.4, yes up to certain extent and,0.871
1323.5,1337.3, it really depends on how much the clients willing to be helped if a person is forced to go into therapy it's really hard for them to open up but overall I would say yes,0.903
1350.3,1362.1, listen to your parents don't be a snob and always put in a hundred percent effort on whatever you're doing because time is running out,0.905
1373.7,1378.4, last time I felt really happy I would say was,0.82
1381.6,1411.2, after my first semester at USC just took my last final it was psych 326 it was Behavior behavior on your science it was really a difficult class for me not just because it's we're looking at brain but you know my first semester here and I was trying to adjust to this new environment while studying this hard material and the end,0.888
1411.9,1422.9, the class with an A and yeah thanks to Professor low Bond it was honestly quite a pleasure in his class just learning all these different stuff it was fascinating,0.849
1433.8,1436.3, definitely my mom and my brother just that,0.875
1437.9,1439.5, they are always,0.633
1441.5,1471, here for me support me even when they're not feeling well and besides them I'd say so my close friends from Community College who also transfer here with me they're always here for me cheer me up when I'm feeling doubt and I'm doing the same thing for them kind of just support each other and honestly without them I really wouldn't be here right now talking to you,0.843
1475.7,1479.8,I don't know why don't you go ask them,0.893
1488.8,1516.5, right so this semester I'm taking this world music class and it turned out that this class has a lot of writing but then at the same time find out that instead of doing one of the longest writing like a final research paper I can just write music and shorten the paper in half I talked to the professor he said yeah you can totally do that,0.841
1516.7,1523.9, so I've been just writing music whenever I'm not studying for my other classes and say that's like,0.88
1525.2,1552.6, really fun and enjoyable process for me just stop everything I'm doing and just me and my guitar writing things just expressing myself and you know share the music I have with my close friends and that's just really what I enjoy doing that really makes me happy,0.777
1561.4,1586.5, nothing to really be proud of I think everything I've accomplished it's all helped through my friends obviously friends and family obviously I did my part and try to get to where I am but I wouldn't say I'm really proud of anything obviously that would be a lie to say we don't have any pride in our self but,0.804
1588.1,1600.6, if you really want me to think of anything that I'm proud of I really want to say nothing because I never really accomplished anything on my own it's always through the help of others,0.847
