248.2,274.9, I think just coming coming here I came here to visit family also this was when I was seven and it really forced me to learn to speak English because I didn't really well I was like learning text book English and I've never really learn conversational English and that was a great experience by the time I left I was,0.847
275.9,295.5, better it was only here for like three months and the United States and by the time I left to go back home I was way better than I anticipated that I would be upon coming here and just being with family and visiting family but yeah,0.858

392.9,420.4, um I think I'm highly introverted and it's it's difficult for me to open up and I get I think I get along better with extroverted people because then I don't have to do as much talking but for the most part I am more comfortable just keeping,0.778
420.6,421.4, myself,0.795
434,438.2, so I live with my parents and,0.868

570.3,573, hardest decision I've ever had to make was,0.882
574.8,602.9, I think choosing which school to come to and it up obviously choosing USC but and all it was a good decision but it was given all the things that were laid out on the table for example money and I guess feasibility feasibility because it's so far away from home and all this other stuff,0.74
605.4,619.7, opportunities and how far have how familiar I am with the surrounding areas and all that other stuff that it was pretty difficult to make a choice but I'm glad I chose what I chose,0.817
629.7,634.3, something I regret definitely,0.85
636.8,645.1, wasting my time not either not being productive or not having fun I feel like I should always be doing one or the other,0.896
646.4,670.7, and that's that's something I regret quite often like I'll procrastinate but I won't be having fun or I won't I'll just be doing nothing and so I won't be productive or be enjoying my time as much as I would like to so that's something that I want to change,0.717
679.7,681.8, an event I could restore my memory,0.775
683.8,685.9, I'm pretty good at,0.664
687.7,690, doing those things by myself,0.836
693.6,694.8, can't think of one right now,0.808
704,704.3, no,0.87
716.3,725.7, little stressed out I have two midterms this week and I don't feel prepared for them so I'm under a little bit of pressure,0.803
726.7,741, trying to move things quickly as quickly as I can get things done and little tasks arise from here and there and it just adds on to the pressure that's already piling up,0.795
745.7,775.3, um I think I don't think there's there any changes in the nature of my actions I just think I've internally I'm more agitated and I'm extremely just makes me rush things and be more hasty and not be I guess which results in being more,0.826
775.5,776.3, negligent,0.791
778.3,786.7, I can't give everything my hundred percent because I'm stressed about getting one thing done while having a lot of other things in mind,0.824
799.5,811.7, it depends usually when I'm stressed it's a way it's a good coping mechanism for me to just go to sleep to avoid my responsibilities,0.901
814.5,827.5, but typically it it more or less it depends on how tired I am how much coffee I drank and all that other stuff all those different factors of the day,0.913
838.2,838.7, what,0.75
845.5,850.5, mmm I'm definitely more tired less productive,0.856
852.3,853.5, and,0.898
855.5,856.2, I guess,0.849
858.7,862.1, I can't put in my hundred percent so I feel a lot of guilt,0.823
864.1,874.1, that I'm not doing my best work because I don't feel physically capable to do so so I think sleep is really important,0.814
876.3,877.7, for me to function properly,0.865
890.8,920.4, sometimes sometimes not sometimes it's just easier to not talk about your problems and sometimes it's it's actually really quite helpful to let it all out and just hear from a third party what your about your thoughts about how you're processing them and how you should go about processing them and how you can come up with Solutions so for the most part I think,0.8
920.6,936, it's helpful but a lot of the times it's hard to even open up if people are dealing with really difficult situations that they don't want to be reminded of and would rather avoid,0.904
944.8,970.9, I think it's I think when dealing with a difficult situation it's a it's an important coping mechanism to be to kind of try to shut it out and try to think about it less than how one would normally how much one would normally think about it for a lot of people on the other hand I think,0.913
972.2,983.6, dwell on it too much and it makes it even worse for them and the situation kind of escalates in their head so it can be either or so I don't really I don't really know how to answer,0.899
994.4,998.8, I was eight ten years ago so,0.777

1039.5,1041.2, who's some of it's been a positive influence,0.55
1042.4,1065.2, so that's been a positive influence My Life um my boyfriend he's very good at being able to stir my negative thoughts away from my mind and just he's a nice distraction to have and someone I can always open up to when I'm upset or distraught or stressed about something,0.819
1066.8,1072.9, and I'm I try to do the same for him but obviously he's much better at at the job than I am,0.895
1084.6,1098, possibly oh no worries oh my best friend describing definitely spontaneous and indecisive,0.876
1100.5,1106.5, maybe hard-working she thinks I work too hard but I don't necessarily agree what was your other question,0.895
1113.1,1137, I did recently that I really enjoyed um I went shopping recently and I love shopping even if it's just window shopping it's nice to be able to leave campus and see the better parts of LA because we're not in a particularly nice area,0.855
