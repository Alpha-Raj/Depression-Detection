599.8,628.5, I think that it's good to have someone to talk to that is emotionally detached from the situations you're going through but also someone that's very rational and can look at the way that you're feeling and validate your feelings and help you understand them better because sometimes I think that's the hardest part is understanding the way you're feeling and understanding why you're feeling that way so having someone just to speak with that nose and that has studied this,0.812
629.1,658.2, and I can look at it from a rational standpoint is very good I think that they could also help you interpret other people's actions that you're dealing with and interacting with that you also don't understand their reactions and sometimes that can cause people to stress so just having someone that can help you understand yourself and others and the mind and general is something that I think is very useful for people that believe they need therapy or not,0.808
