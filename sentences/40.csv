37.2,40.8, I'm doing okay a little stressed but nothing too serious,0.87
47.3,49.1, Boston Massachusetts,0.745
57.1,66.2, I really like how spread out it is you can really see different areas and they're all very separate and I also like how close it is to the water I love the beach,0.837
70.9,93.8, this might be just because of how we're USC is located but there seems to be a lot of poverty and it can make situations uncomfortable also I don't like how you can't really walk around a lot of places you really need transportation and Uber but other than that I like the city a lot,0.873
107.4,118.7, not really I've been to Paris but other than that I haven't been outside of the country and then I'm from the East Coast so I've been to both coasts of the u.s. but other than that not really,0.886
127.9,136.4, I don't know it's mostly just I go on trips with my family so whenever's convenient we go somewhere but a lot of the time we just prefer to stay home,0.911
144,158.2, definitely when I went to Paris I have an aunt who lives in the middle of the country and the countryside and she has this really big house and all of her neighbors speak French no English and I took French in high school so it was a very interesting experience,0.876
163.2,175.9, I was always science particularly biology that's why my major is biology now and I also that's part of the reason why I want to become a doctor,0.86
182.7,189.7, now I still study bio and I'm on the pre-medical track so I'm on my way to going into medical school hopefully,0.758
202.7,216.6, something else well in high school I was very into theater and I worked as a stage manager I didn't like to act but I like to be behind the scenes so if I could live in some other life I would definitely want to pursue that and become a stage manager may be on Broadway,0.875
225.8,226.8, definitely more shy,0.907
234,244.3, I'm just more reserved naturally and I prefer to have people approach me than to for me to approach them and I just I often like to listen instead of speak,0.9
251.9,265.3, me and my family were really close I have a younger sister and a younger brother my sisters only two years younger than me so I would say we're the closest but overall like the five of us are really close and we're very honest with each other,0.766
270.2,284.8, honestly I like to watch Netflix and just lay in my bed and not really think about like all of the other stressors in my life just kind of something that will take my mind off of it,0.843
292,305.3, I'm very like cool minded I don't really get angry so I'm very like I like to say I'm cool calm and collected and other people have said that also I just don't really Express a lot of emotion,0.899
314.2,335.1, it was probably with my dad about working of working over the summer I really want to go back to Camp as a camp counselor but he thinks I need to do something more medical related so we definitely an argument about that but we ended up working it out we came to a compromise I'm going back so that's good,0.734
352.6,377.1, in I'm part of a club right now and there was one situation where they wanted me to participate and speak in front of everybody but I kind of like refused and it created like an awkward situation and I probably should have just accepted the request and just spoke in front of people but instead I kind of made a big deal about it and wouldn't say anything,0.909
391.2,418.6, I think when my sister she's applying to colleges now and at the very beginning she wasn't really sure where she wanted to apply and I think I kind of guilted her into applying to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire just because I wanted her to go there and I thought it was a good fit and so I kind of made a reply lead even though she didn't really want to and she didn't end up getting in which I think is for the best but I do feel guilty about like forcing her to do something she might not have wanted,0.843
436,465.2, that was probably applying to college I was between USC and University of Rochester in Upstate New York both of which are really different places but I was in love with both of them and I really kind of hard time deciding which one to go to and I just knew like either place would change like the course of my life and so it was a really hard decision but in the end I decided if I went to Rochester I definitely would have regretted or wondered what it would have been like it,0.873
465.4,475.5, the see where as now that I met USC I probably or I'm not really thinking about how it would have been at Rochester so I've definitely think I made the right choice but it was really hard to dance to make,0.708
490.3,517.3, something I regret probably just not not reciprocating as much with my sister I think she really wants the two of us to be close and of course I want that also but I think she puts in a lot more than I do and I sometimes after situation will regret like not saying everything I was feeling or opening up as much because I know that she's really working hard and trying to and I'm not really reciprocating,0.912
522.1,551.8, is kind of funny I guess but in fifth grade I was acting as Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory the play and the chocolate river that I was supposed to fall into instead they had it like a chocolate bucket and so there was a trash can that was put on wheels so it could easily be rolled away after and they did forgot to lock the wheels so when I went head first into the trash can it,0.888
551.9,559.9, old and fell over off the stage so that was pretty embarrassing and friends still bring it up to this day so I would definitely like to erase that from my memory,0.865
571.6,572.3, nope,0.672
583.2,602.3, pretty okay honestly this semester I have a big course load and I also in joining this club again that I mentioned before that is very time consuming so I'm a little stressed just about handling everything but it's honestly not much more than any other semester with my major there's always stress,0.814
616.7,634.3, not really you know I've just that's that point in the semester where I'm just really looking forward to the end and summer so I guess that's like a change from in the beginning when you're excited about the semester but I don't think that's due to anything like specifically negative that's happening I think that's just the normal mentality I always have,0.802
639.7,659.7, very easy like I'm a very deep sleeper I can sleep pretty much anywhere so it's not hard for me to fall asleep it might not be for a really long time but I usually wake up pretty rested just because I've been like I sleep very soundly,0.912
666.9,683.4, when I don't sleep well I'm just pretty irritable like I just don't really I don't have patience I don't put up with a lot and I just I'm constantly thinking about getting sleep and it just impacts everything it's just it's a bad situation which is I've always known that I always need sleep,0.89
699.2,725.9, I think for many people it's really useful personally I've never done it before I just don't really see a need to like I'm a pretty open person I'm reserved but like I speak when I feel like I need to and so I never I don't really have a lot of bottled-up emotions per se so I never really felt the need to like use that as a way to release but I completely understand the practice of it and I know it works for a lot of people,0.889
740,767.2, um just you know keep your eyes like open and in the moment you know you I'm very goal-oriented and so if I could have I mean I can take this advice now too but in general just kind of keep in mind that your life is happening every second and so you don't want to always be looking forward because you're going to forget about the moments that are happening right around you so just living in the moment I guess,0.783
786.9,811.9, probably when I got my big in this club that I've been referring to you know she was kind of friends with her before and she really made it seem like we weren't going to be matched together and so I was totally thrown off and I was really curious who I was going to get and then the reveal was where they're wrapped up in wrapping paper and you pull it away and so I just like ripped it open and it was her standing there smiling and,0.865
812.2,815.3, that was just a really nice moment I was very happy and excited,0.812
828.3,850.7, I would say my friend Miguel we met last semester actually and he just has a really good work ethic he's always around and he needs to talk to him he really inspires me to like keep going with the pre-medical process even when it's really difficult and I really value his advice and I know he has the best intentions,0.909
855.3,884.3, I think they would say that I'm really hard working and I don't really stop doing something until it's complete but that being said it can detract me from things that could be more important or I could spend my time in better ways but also that I have a good sense of humor and I like to be light and I don't really like to get extremely deep and serious like to keep it light,0.853
888.6,911.7, well recently my friend visited from Boston it was her spring break and she'd never been to California so I planned out like a full for day adventure so to speak and we went all around La so all the major sites we went to the Grove Santa Monica the Huntington Gardens in Pasadena,0.811
914,924.7, the LACMA the braud Grand Central Market all of that stuff so that was just really fun you know it was a good way it was a week after my spring break so it was a good way to ease back into the rest of the semester,0.701
930.3,959.9, I think I'm most proud of my determination and my work ethic and setting my mind to something because I know a lot of people can really fluctuate and I've kind of been pretty steady the whole time which isn't always a good thing you know you want to be able to change and adapt but I'm pretty proud of myself for having this idea I'm really sticking with it and following it through and I mean that's like being pre-med and becoming a doctor but yeah,0.88
960.1,960.9, pretty proud of that,0.913
