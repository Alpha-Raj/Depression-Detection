96.5,113.5, I know I mean I guess that it can be kind of difficult to live here and there's like some of the changes changes that have been happening to the community and like the different people that live here like gentrification and those sort of things but other than that there isn't really much about the see that I don't like,0.82

263.9,279.3, I'm pretty close to my family so I have a really small family like speaking to my like extended family but so I have my mom and my dad and my brother and we're all like pretty close we've always gotten along well and there hasn't been like a really big issue between any of us,0.768
284.6,301.5,I love reading so if I can do that then I'll do that but I also really like watching movies or just YouTube videos so like sort of online media and also sometimes just listening to music I'm really into Broadway so I like the stories of those songs tell,0.855
309.3,327.8, I think I'm pretty good at it I really get mad at people like sometimes I might get irritated but I've never been like Furious that somebody so it's find it pretty easy to keep that in check and not really snap at somebody if I'm not feeling very happy to be around them,0.848
340.3,340.9, um,0.895
342.1,370.5, the last argument I think it might have been with one of my roommates and it wasn't really much of an argument I would say we were just discussing like just that like she was barely around and like how we were kind of feeling about how she wasn't really interacting with us anymore but it didn't really get like he did I think it was more just about like a discussion but it was pretty emotional I would say so some people seemed angry than others,0.798
378.3,407.9, hmm um in this is kind of going a little bit far back but I had a friend back in like Middle School that like started hanging out with some other people which now I can look back and think of as normal but in the moment I felt kind of like betrayed in a way and the people she started hanging out with her son that I didn't really like it,0.863
408.1,427.8, so I chose to let her go as a friend instead of like letting her have multiple friend groups which is now like something that I think was a little immature but I was also young but thinking back it would have been nice to maybe not just drop a friendship that I think had nothing else wrong with it,0.876
439.5,444.8, um guilty I guess sometimes like,0.907
447.1,468, I tell like small like lies I guess mainly of a mission to some of my friends from not as close with and like feel bad about it in the moment but sometimes they're just like things that I don't want to talk about so it's like hard to like I guess open up to them but and I feel bad about that but it's something I'll get too I guess,0.844
480.2,505.3, I think recently one of the hardest decisions I made was choosing what college to go to so I was really stuck between coming to USC or to UCLA which is also a really good school and I was like thrilled to be accepted into both and I just had a really hard time deciding which one to go to because some of my best friends in high school were going to UCLA and it would have been kind of like a dream just go to college with them but,0.894
506.1,516.6, I also really liked you I see and I like the program they had from my major and it just seemed like the better choice but I was struggling really hard because I didn't want to regret the choice that I made,0.78
529.6,542.7, I don't really think I regret much I try not to like there might be small decisions but I've never at least not off the top of my head I can't think of something that I'm genuinely done that I wholeheartedly like regret and wish I could change,0.891
552.2,576.3, I don't think there is anything I would I feel like everything that I've done it was there or not I'm proud of it like if I've messed up in some way I think is like been crucial and I can't imagine just getting rid of something and like I don't know the I feel like I would worry too much about how that would affect the rest of what I've done and I'm pretty happy with where I am right now and so I don't think I would change anything,0.751
583.7,586.4, nope,0.913
597.1,614.5, I've been feeling pretty good other than stress from my classes I haven't having to use super down moments I've had like a pretty good semester I feel like this semester has been a lot better than last semester I've kind of gotten used to the way College works and so it's been like a lot more fun I think,0.873

623.7,631.2,I don't think so not anything that I've noticed,0.725

670,689.5, I'm very tired and I get headaches pretty easily when I'm not tired but I don't not usually I don't think at least I don't think I got any like more irritable at least not that I've noticed and I usually make time to take a nap if I'm very tired just so I can be the most energized I can be,0.815
697.1,714.6, I think so I've personally never been to therapy although I've been curious about trying it but I can see how it's useful and I have friends who go to therapy often and they have found it to be like a very helpful experience with like dealing with what they're going through,0.851
729.8,751.3, ten years ago it was nine I'm not 20 yet so I can't do that one but ten years ago um I don't know I can't really like my 9 year old self I think it was pretty happy I think I didn't really faced any sort of big issues because I was in elementary school back then so probably just to like remember,0.76
752.5,766.1, who I am and just like not let what's coming because Middle School wasn't a pretty difficult time like not let that get to me and just know that it'll turns out okay like not have to stress about what the future looks like,0.761
781.8,787.3, well I guess I like it just a gent as I was happy yesterday I don't know I don't know like,0.793
788.4,803.6, if that was really happy I guess I was in my apartment with my roommates and like our friends and we were just all hanging out and talking like we normally do we were just like laughing at I don't even know what we were playing with like a bobbin so it was just a really fun time,0.812
814.8,843.6, I think I've had quite a couple but I'd probably say that my best friend who I've known since the second grade is really like been there through a lot since like the second grade till now there's been obviously a lot of changes in both of our lives but constantly having like one consistent friend I think through all of it has been a lot of fun and she's helped me be more open with other people and kind of like not be as scared to try new things and also was just really supportive through especially,0.861
843.8,857.1, High School like all the struggles I was going through with classes and then when I came when it came time to pick a university she was really support 'full supportive and in my decision and didn't make me feel bad about it,0.854
864.5,881.5, I think she would say she always likes to say that I'm like one of the smartest people that she knows but I mean I could see the same likewise but I think she's saying funny and it's relatively outgoing and shy kind of makes of the to probably very determined and probably a little stubborn,0.869
