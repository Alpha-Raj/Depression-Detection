288.7,310.4, I'd say pretty good I don't really consider myself having a temper I do get really stressed out in certain ways and I take it out on maybe like my mom or whoever I'm talking to at the time just out of stress but I don't really get super angry about a certain subject or something that happens,0.82
321.8,335.8, I argued today actually with my boyfriend over living situations in La for over the summer but it was just a little argument it wasn't very angry,0.86
344.1,364.9, I have a number of confrontations with my roommates that I probably wish would have been handled a little differently sometimes we can get a little passive-aggressive and I wish we would rather confront each other about our problems than just ignore each other,0.908
373.7,394.6, I would say mostly about my roommate confrontation rule might lack of confrontation with my roommates I wish I could have just mended problems a lot earlier than letting them kind of come into something bigger than they needed to be,0.839
415.9,445.8, the hardest decision I've ever had to make I guess it was this summer this spring semester I kind of either wanted to decided whether or not it was good to start and having a job or to just enjoy my last semester as a senior at USC so I knew it would make my parents happy if I got a job and I knew it would obviously look good for applying to grad school and everything so but I always do really enjoy my free time and so that was really difficult for me,0.893

599.5,602.6, yes absolutely,0.87
607.2,636, I always kind of felt myself taking I like bottling things up and I'm an only child and really the only person I talk to about my problems as my mom and like maybe a friend or two I don't really trust a lot of people with my problems so I went to a therapist this summer and it was just great to finally talk about you know my problems and get it like a very outside perspective that doesn't have the bias of my mom or my friends,0.763
