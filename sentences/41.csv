91.5,108.2, I don't like that Lala in La it's hard to have strong Community people here are focused more on their careers I feel like then just hanging out with people it's more about networking,0.848
120.5,136.5, I feel like I travel a good amount compared to what I thought my life would be I travel at least once a year which is a lot to me so,0.802
145.4,168.6, I like experiencing new things I love sightseeing but I also like actively doing things like ziplining but also I like just like being on a tour bus and trying new food just experiencing the culture and the people as well,0.886
173.6,174.3, I'd like to hear about,0.791
177.2,204.9, recently I went to Italy my boyfriend knew that I didn't like my birthday which is on New Year's and so he surprised me with paid off trip to Italy super fun we went to Milan Florence and Venice it a lot of pasta and pizza did a lot of sightseeing we even stopped at the Swiss Alps for a day,0.909
205.9,225.2, this really relaxing really beautiful yeah I don't usually go to places just to sightsee I usually do like activities and stuff but I really love the culture and just being able to be in a new area that was just that was super fun for me so,0.908
242.2,244.3, in Life or in travel,0.91
250.5,280.2, okay so I am just going to assume that this is a question about life I think one of my most memorable experiences was releasing my first song I got to play with a band for the first time and we played at a party it was super fun everyone is dancing my sister and my,0.895
280.6,299.6, actually surprised me by coming to the show from the Bay Area and that was just a great time even though I hate this track now it still was just such a good memory considering that I never thought that that was going to be something that was possible for me so yeah,0.908
311.1,340.9, High School my favorite subject was Art I just felt like I had so much freedom to do what I wanted I just did Art one and my teacher allowed me to just jump to a PR the very next year so in a PRI just got to make whatever I wanted and it was really nice I had really good friends there I was always really motivated to make new things,0.89
341.1,350.8, that are really believed in so yeah I think in high school that was really the peak of my just my experience with Fine Arts,0.854
357.6,377.4, right now I am a major and psychology I'm also a musician I took a two year break and was a CNA for a bit that was super fun after psychology I want to go into nursing so right now I'm just focusing on music and school,0.842
393.5,408.3, something else that's hard to say because music and nursing those are really my ultimate dream jobs but if I were to choose something else,0.867
411.8,433.1, like maybe a travel blogger something where I get to travel for free or go into acting I'm not sure I'm just like so focused on music and nursing so it's just hard for me to decide any other field I'd be super unfamiliar with and yeah,0.907
441.5,446.4, oh sorry go on,0.817
457.4,486.4, I'm going to answer the question I wasn't really talking so I don't know anyways I am more of I'd say I'm really talking it evolved but I am somebody who would much rather stay home who gets anxious and big crowds I'm really good at pretending that I'm not anxious I talk a lot but usually I would just I am the type of personal cancel plans and I totally,0.833
486.8,493.5, or just not being in huge group settings that's why Italy was great because I didn't have to have a birthday party or anything,0.797
502.8,503, I,0.702
506.3,535.9, I'm not sure why I think maybe I don't know it's so easy for us to just blame childhood but I don't know in middle school I was with like the popular crowd super extroverted and you know I had a rough time with bullying and everything and I moved out of the school I think that's what I learned that it's really important to protect your heart and so ever since then I've just been really careful,0.913
536,565.7, it's not like I am afraid of people necessarily I think it's just become like a habit to really be selective of who I hang out with but also I'm just really busy and I live with my family and my family is more than enough for me I just love hanging out with my sister and my mom so yeah I think going out and talking to people I feel like there's a lot of times where you'll meet people and doesn't really go anywhere,0.901
566,570.1, where and I'd rather just invest my time in the friends that I have now,0.71
578.5,607.4,so my dad is currently in San Francisco my parents have been divorced since I was in Middle School I am not as close with my dad but I am working on it we used to have a pretty bad relationship but it's a lot better now so I'm super blessed about that my mom and my sister actually moved in with me this year which is incredible,0.907
608,625.4, I just can't even believe that they just changed their whole life just to be with me and really support me here my mom my sister they're my best friends I definitely am super dependent on them but yeah,0.905
639.5,666.1, I usually just talk to my sister when I'm I have downtown time I don't really like just chilling and watching a TV show or anything I like doing things so maybe I'll go out and eat with my sister or I'll just walk on my treadmill for a bit,0.822
666.3,672.1, but that's rare but yeah my dad time is just hanging out with my family,0.7
680.9,707.9, I am not good at controlling my temper I rarely get upset outside of my relationship so with my boyfriend we get into a lot of arguments but I must say I am better at controlling my temper that he is so I don't know I know I get really upset it's really hard for me to control that but usually the anger just leads to sadness,0.82
708.1,709.2, really quickly so,0.699
712.3,725, yeah I don't really I feel like I don't get angry that much considering that I only get upset in my relationship it's really hard to make me upset outside of that so,0.835
733.4,742.6, no I'm not that angry of person so yeah I don't think anybody would even describe me as a very angry person,0.713
747.4,776.5, last time I argue with my boyfriend was two weeks ago and it was a really stupid argument he we were eating with my friends and we're talking about Asian American Standards with parents and I was talking about how it was really hard for me to meet standards that his parents had for me,0.765
777.5,794.5, and he sugar-coated the whole situation and I told him after that I didn't like how he made it seem like I was lying and we gone to a huge huge argument but it's done now he's sorry about it so,0.723
811.4,840, I wish I handled that situation differently when I'm annoyed I rarely watch what words I'm using and even though in my mind I don't think it's a defensive I should have understood that he does have an anger problem and I should be sensitive to that I told him that I was annoyed at him sugarcoating things and I just should have,0.911
840.1,869.6, I wish you had done a little differently you know I know that you didn't intend to do that I'm just telling you so it doesn't happen again I feel like I should be more gentle with him because when I do that it's really hard for him to listen and then we start yelling and I feel like none like I don't feel hurt and he doesn't feel heard and it's just,0.887
870.1,871.3, super unproductive,0.77
890.2,918.6, I don't really carry the feeling of guilt usually but there are things that I wish I could do better on a daily basis I wish that I was better to my mom I feel like I should be helping around the house a lot more she wants me to sleep early more often and that's something I could easily do and I don't do it,0.912
918.8,930.7, and she gave up her whole entire life to be with me so I yeah I think I should just be better and those like everyday tasks that really make her day easier,0.792
951.6,973.2, I think it was when I decided to leave school I was always defined I also always defined myself by being like a straight A student and I realized that I didn't know why I was working so hard towards something that I didn't enjoy I Was A Fine Arts major back in the day I was,0.792
973.4,998.2, I was going through a really tough time in my family and my mental health and deciding to leave school obviously I was faced with a lot of opposition and leaving school I didn't know what I was doing I was just kind of leaving in the dark and so that was that was a really tough decision on me and going back to school was also a really big decision to use,0.913
1010.8,1011.7, hmm,0.616
1014.5,1016.6, I don't know like,0.798
1019,1048.2, I guess trusting certain people I regret doing that but you know II don't really like saying I really regret any of those things because I learned a lot from those experiences so usually when people ask me if I actually regret anything it's something stupid and small like dying my hair blue in middle school or something because I don't think I would want to change any of my experiences because they really shaped me to be who I am today,0.791
1065.8,1092.5, they're like these little moments of my life that just like when people were just really mean or just like went out of their way to just make me upset and honestly I could only think of like to on the top of my head and didn't influence my life and anyway didn't change the direction of my life anyway and so if I could wipe those memories out that'd be cool but yeah still it's not that big of a deal,0.82
1104.5,1107.9, I have not but my boyfriend has,0.85
1119,1143.9, I have been feeling really unmotivated and unexcited for things yesterday my sister was feeling the same way so we just had like a depressed day yesterday and we just went out eight so yeah just really unmotivated but it's not like a super severe depression or anything yet yeah,0.877
1153.4,1173.7, yeah I feel like because I'm less motivated I work out a lot less and less likely to do my homework or make it on time to school even though I made it to all my classes so that's pretty impressive but,0.913
1176.4,1179.6, yeah so I think that's the main difference,0.828
1189,1195.7, it's pretty easy for me to have a good night's sleep actually I sleep like a sleep really really easily like a baby,0.88
1204.1,1230.3, really groggy really tired I fall asleep in class sometimes I'd say it makes me like emotionally just like a little bit more down and I don't really function well doing anything so what I'm really tired usually I just go home and I sleep for very long time we're coffee,0.765
1234.8,1235.2, okay,0.913
1241.2,1259.6, I do I have therapy for good like three or four years and yeah really changed my life I don't do anymore because I feel like I don't really need it anymore but yeah,0.833
1271.4,1280.2, I would have been like,0.833
1281.1,1288.5, just like 10 or four years old I would say,0.756
1291.9,1318.8, take the time to learn things on your own don't want you for your parents to have the time or the money to pay for those things YouTube is a thing learn what you love and don't give up don't take your parents mistakes personally and choose your friends wisely don't prioritize,0.906
1319.8,1327.2, you know social status and school yeah,0.858
1350.1,1371.6, I feel like I mean I was really happy when I was in Italy because it was just a new experience I was rarely like sad or anything yeah it was just a new experience and I was with my boyfriend who I love very very much so yeah that's probably the last time I was like extremely extremely happy,0.872
1377.4,1407, he's the one that's been a positive influence in your life I would say my mentor her name is Kate she took me in when I was like a middle school she's my best friend's mom call her my fairy Godmother she saw that I was really struggling in the middle school that I was at she took me out put me in private school got me a full scholarship she was a singer and she trained,0.825
1407.3,1428.7, I was super tone-deaf and she had the balls to tell me that I was not good and she put me in a guitar lessons and she was basically my mom you know and to this day she still acts like my mom and she just really really changed my life and shaped me me to be the person that I am today,0.789
1439.8,1444.1, I don't really know I guess ambitious,0.867
1455.4,1470.1, I went on a really fun date in San Francisco we went to the Cal Academy we went to the Conservatory of Flowers we really good food it was just like a really nice day of just not worrying about anything yeah,0.907
1482.6,1510.2, I think I'm proud of overcoming all of the obstacles in my life like I feel like I went through a lot of trauma for my age and overcoming that is just crazy and being able to accomplish things while overcoming those obstacles like you know doing music which is something that I never thought I'd be,0.901
1510.4,1516.7, I have enough to do and being able to go back to school yeah I don't take those things for granted at all,0.752
1553.1,1554.5, knock on the door,0.605
