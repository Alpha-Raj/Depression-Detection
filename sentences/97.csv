347.7,371.1, hmm good question what I do to relax sometimes during my free time when I'm stressed and I want to relax I try to watch YouTube videos things just to make me laugh and not just to forget about things that I am stressing about and just want to relax and stuff sometimes meditating but it depends,0.911
378.2,396.2, temper I'm good at it I think if I ever do get mad I just kind of pour it out and vent it to like a friends but I don't like have like violent actions or anything I think I just vented out or I just like want to talk it out because I thought that's helpful for me,0.854
405.7,428.4, um last person I argued with someone would have to be probably my brother because I told him to go sleep early because he was going to go sleep late I told him no go sleep early because like he had a early class in next morning it was in a big argument but then yeah I mean eventually he slept early listen to me,0.909
436.7,444.6, I wish I handled differently hmm good question,0.81
446.5,475.8, um well in high school there is a situation of a bunch of girls being mean to this one certain girl and instead of defending her in a sense I defended her indirectly but I think if I were to go back I would want to defend her directly and not just stand there and be a bystander so much to an extent but rather just like address it to people hey guys stop being mean to her I kind of sometimes when I think back I'm like I wish I kind of did that but like I,0.859
476,482.4, like when people talked about her quietly look I would stand up to her but I just hope I wished I did it more directly,0.825
495.3,520.1, I think money and just in general like being a student at USC and my mom sacrificed so much that sometimes when we have to buy textbooks or like things that I want or also need but I feel guilty by them because I'm like so much money because already tuitions a lot so I feel guilty about it sometimes,0.902

555.5,580.4, probably deciding what college to go to when I came out of senior year because obviously I didn't get into my dream school who I see but the more I thought about these other colleges it was really hard to decide whether or not I want to go to those or just go to Community College or do I really want a college experience so that was a really big decision for me and it was very hard because I didn't know which path to go,0.846
591.1,591.6, okay,0.913
600,623.1, something I regret I think my lat since I'm a transfer student my first year I went to another University and I kind of regret going it to it sometimes because I wished I maybe have gone to Community College and I saved a lot more money but it's okay cuz I guess it got me here so,0.906
637,640.3, mmm that's a good question,0.735
645.7,675, I think well in high school there was just a lot of drama senior year regarding just friends and prom and all these senior school activities that everyone wanted to do and somehow I just got in the middle of it and I just wish that none of that drama was there because it's you know it's our last year of high school so I wished that that was a race like the drama and the negativity and the bullying people and just talking about,0.863
675.2,678.2, about people and stuff and just rather than it doing that,0.825
679.5,685.1, just have fun because it was your last you know it was our last year of high school so I wish that I just enjoyed my senior year or more,0.872

694.8,695.1, hmm,0.564
703.8,709.2, no I have not unfortunately but maybe possibility I would be interested in it,0.818
713.1,713.6, okay,0.832
716.4,746.3, um to be quite honest there's some days I feel happy and excited because it's like a certain day that I don't have that many classes but other times I just feel stressed that or overwhelmed in the sense like if I'm studying enough if if I should be not slacking off and just I don't know I just feel stressed just because I want to do well in my classes and it's only us already the midterm kind of season so I hope to do better but,0.901
746.4,749.9, don't feel super stressed all the time maybe just like once or twice,0.813
753.2,753.7, excuse me,0.779
764.6,791, not really and if there were changes it was very minimal I mean if I am stressed sometimes and I have not been eating like I'm working on homework or I'm just like going to class and just day-to-day stuff and I don't have time I do feel hungry so I seem to be a little quick tempered but it's not to the point where it's very noticeable but I know myself that I that I didn't eat or something,0.91
795.8,818.8, um I feel like last semester was easy but this semester May because over winter break my sleep schedule wasn't that great there's some days it's a lot easier and most days I don't know why but it feels harder but I think maybe it's because I'm using my phone or not I don't know,0.74
827.7,849.2, I'm just tired most of the time I get over it like when I'm in class I feel a lot more energetic because I'm an outgoing energetic person but sometimes I just feel tired throughout the day and then I feel energetic or I filled energetic and then I kind of like hit a wall and I'm like really tired let's take a nap or something so it kind of depends on the day,0.788
859.6,885.2, I think so I think just talking to someone and having someone being there just for you for you to vent out your feelings or just to give you advice as a lot more helpful when you talk to someone who really doesn't know what they're doing or just wants to I mean if someone's there just to listen that's fine but like for advice why sometimes it's hard to find people who can give good advice I think therapy is very useful actually,0.844
894.6,923.8, hmm 10 20 years ago so I was like ten years old probably I would just tell myself not to conform as much even though it probably don't know what that meant back then just not to worry about what other people are thinking or buying or wearing because you should just be yourself I felt like I was always just relating to people's Trends and what other girl,0.726
924,927.7, Ward I feel like I should have just stuck to my own roots and be myself more,0.781
942.4,955.7, last weekend when I got to see my mom and the whole family were together and I just we're having dinner and it just felt like I was so happy because we were bonding so much made a lot of funny jokes and watched a movie later so I felt very happy,0.806
960.7,961.3, that's good,0.913
968.9,988.3, definitely my mom or my brother they have always given me the best advice and always have contact me reached out to me to make sure that I feel okay and that I should stress as much and to just live a good life because Life's too short I know that's cheesy but it's true,0.834
993.3,1014.8, good question I would say probably very funny friendly / outgoing and just compassionate I really care about my friends so if they're in a time of need I'm always there One Call Away,0.909
1024.2,1025.4, I really enjoyed,0.841
1030.8,1053.1, I recently I think yesterday I went out with my friend and grab coffee and had Le a dinner and we just talked for like three hours and I really enjoyed it because we were just I just love talking to people and she's even though she's a new friend I just loved doing other people's presence so it was fun we got to talk about anything so I enjoyed it,0.788
1059.6,1089.2,well to be quite honest just kinda getting into UIC since such a honorary school and throughout these 19 years working up to it and feeling proud that I'm going to a school where they're all people of all walks of life and like with people who have such Bright Futures ahead of them and knowing that I'm getting to go to school with them every day on,0.805
1089.4,1096.6, Lee it's the biggest accomplishment I think I've had yet so we'll see it after I graduate what's in store,0.9
