215.7,241, I would have to say probably going to India this winter break but like as well as traveling to Europe like 2 years ago was really awesome I got to go to different countries so I think that just getting to experience a different culture is really cool and I went to India with my sister so it was really nice to get to have that experience with someone that I'm really close to and that I really care about,0.857
248.2,277.6, I always enjoyed math and science science I just loved biology the most and like learning about how the body works and how like animals and humans kind of interact with our environment and just like how those systems function and then for math I just I don't know I always felt really comfortable with like working with numbers and it felt like it came a little more naturally to me so I had always enjoyed,0.862
277.8,281.5, it more because it was maybe a little easier than the other subjects,0.879
287.6,302.2, so now I'm studying Health and Human Sciences so I kind of get to tap into that like love of biology that I have and just learning about you know diseases or like different things like that that affect humans,0.905

350.1,354.3, like future Generations who like consume content through social media,0.869
363,391.8, I feel like I am in introvert and extrovert in certain situations I can be really shy sometimes especially when I'm uncomfortable with people but in like certain settings or maybe I have to talk in front of a classroom or like give a speech and things like that I'm a little more extroverted and not as scared to do those things and then also once I get comfortable with people I seem to be a little more extroverted so I think I start off shy and then kind of grow into a more,0.892
391.9,393.2, extroverted person,0.913
399.8,417.4, I think just the like fear or of like not knowing someone I think it's always an uncomfortable situation and sometimes I think I worry too much about like what they might think of me or if I'll be like too much if I'm extroverted so I think I've just always,0.903
418.5,441.5, like I have an older sister and a younger brother so like my older sister I've always had like she can do like I don't know it's really hard to explain but she's been like really extroverted so I feel like I don't really have to do as much and those settings so I kind of just start off a little shy because I may be uncomfortable or like fear what other people might think of me,0.913
445.7,475.2,I think my relationship with my family is like really really close I'm Mexican American and especially in like Mexican culture a lot of the things you do are with your family and they'll even like extended family not only my immediate family so like I really feel confident and going to like my parents if I ever need anything and I'm really close with my siblings but not only that they're like some of my closest like best friends I would say and then,0.913
475.6,486.1, my extended family you know like they're always around for like important celebrations like graduations or birthdays so like being really close to my family is really important to me,0.898
494.8,515.6, sometimes I'll like treat myself to watching maybe a Netflix show or movie I really enjoy like playing sport so maybe I'll go play basketball because I kind of get my mind off of like everyday stress things that are going on in life and like school and work yeah,0.905
526.6,549.9, I think I'm pretty good at controlling my temper and like keeping things in and kind of like getting angry outside of a situation that may make me angry I think sometimes if I'm being pushed a little too much then maybe I'm not as good as at controlling it but for the most part I think I'm very good at kind of,0.908
550.8,563.5, calming down and assessing the situation and maybe getting angry at it a little later like with myself on my own time instead of you know maybe hurting someone's feelings and going off on them when something's happening,0.885
572.1,601.3, I think I probably argued with one of my parents and I think I was probably angry about them picking me up late or something I think it was my dad because he's very bad at getting places on time and he's constantly like saying oh I'll be there I'll be there and he always gets places late and I'm very I'm someone who likes to like have things done on time or let people know if I'm going to beat like exactly what time I'm going to be there so especially because it's like a,0.913
601.5,615.4, constant behavior of him being late I think I get a little more I get angry at him more easily and especially because I feel more comfortable with him I feel like I can express my feelings more so I think I got angry at my dad about that,0.907
631.7,661.2, I think differently is more like situations in general that I think I should handle better I think is with my parents because I do seem to get a little more like unable to handle my temper when I'm around them I think maybe just because I feel more comfortable with them and I know sometimes like they're they have stressful things to that are going on in their lives and me being angry at them for small things maybe isn't the best thing so I think just handling those and,0.862
661.4,668.3, you're standing like their point of view and what's going on in their lives should is something that I need to work on,0.901
683.4,686, I think I think maybe,0.777
688.4,717.9, I guess being ungrateful for things sometimes especially I going to USC is to really expensive school and it's really awesome that I get to go here and sometimes I take that for granted by like how I like treat people or how like I'm going about like using the resources that I have here and maybe like not doing like not taking advantage of the opportunities given here so I think I need to do a better job of maybe like looking at those and,0.786
718.1,728.2, and I guess I'd feel guilty about it because like my parents sacrificed so much for me to be here so like if I don't do it to the best of my ability I feel like I'm like doing a disservice to them,0.904
742.3,770, I feel like I've been like pretty blessed in like having to make hard decisions so this might not seem like it's a hard decision but I guess having to choose like what school like what college I wanted to go to whether I wanted to like be far from home or be here and I was lucky enough to have really good options and like really supportive parents who would accept in like we're supported me in any decision I made,0.887
770.2,787.5, so I think it was really hard trying to figure out if I wanted to be close to home or go far away and I ended up staying closer to home but I think that was one of the hardest decisions having to make especially because College seems to like it seems to be a decision that kind of,0.792
789.3,792, makes up what your whole future is going to be,0.871
805.3,834.9, hmm something I regret is maybe like my performance this first semester of college it hasn't been the best and it has been a bit of a hard transition even though I'm I'm lucky to be close to home so I think I regret maybe like not studying as hard not really paying attention and classes,0.874
836.4,844.9, so I think I regret maybe like my decisions and time management and like studying and what not,0.82
858.2,859.8, I don't think I have one,0.851
861.1,867.8, probably because I've really blocked it out of my memory but like so far I think,0.843
868.8,887.2, everything has been well and I don't really have anything that I want to block out of my memory especially because like I think it's important that like any memories I have is like what made me the person I am today so I don't really think I have a specific thing that I want to like erase from my memory,0.907
