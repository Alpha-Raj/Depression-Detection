25.5,26.2,oh yes,0.8
38.9,53.3,I woke up early for the first time in a long time so that was nice and I have got to know a lot of work done and I'm applying to grad school so it's been a pretty productive day so far,0.903
59.6,61.4, and from Cerritos California,0.831
69.6,86.6, I think the biggest thing is the complete access to every food I could possibly imagine I enjoy that and being able to experience Cuisines from different cultures and that are all very nearby,0.824
95.1,122.2, I don't enjoy the fact that I don't feel safe walking around I don't really enjoy the pace of life here I think it's not healthy and I think a lot of people and I'll lay are very overworked and trying to keep up with the pace of life that just people and humans aren't meant to keep up with and it's also kind of dirty,0.896
133.4,148.8, I used to travel a lot when I was a kid my mom took me to many countries so I've been around the world quite a bit for someone my age but I haven't really been able to travel a lot in the past few years because of college,0.904
156.6,186.2, I think there's a sense of Freedom first especially when you're with I'm only 22 but when you're with like other people your age without quote quote adult supervision and because you are the adult now I think there's a big sense of Independence and I really enjoy exploring new places and walking up and down these streets and imagining how it would be like to live there as a local so Angela,0.913
186.6,193.8, and I like photography so I often take pictures of places I travel of which is very fun,0.846
204.7,233.4, this past January I turned 22 and as a birthday present to myself I took a solo trip to Solvang which was the first time I traveled alone and really did anything that adventurous by myself so that was really exciting and I drove five to six hours to solving because the freeway was closed because the mudslides and it was just very restful and I got,0.913
233.5,256.7, it just sing in the car and call some friends and just take my time walking through solving and not worrying about doing getting anything accomplished but just enjoying the sights and enjoying the Solitude which I don't have a lot of at College because you live with people you go to class with people so yeah,0.87
267.1,268.2, in general,0.774
271.3,300.8, that's a very vague question current memorable experience that I talk to someone about recently was when I lived in the San Bernardino Forest this past summer for three months and I lived with three other younger College woman and was basically their mentor and that was something I've never experienced before and I feel a lot more prepared to be a,0.863
301,305.8, right now because of that experience so that was pretty memorable,0.745
314.1,340.2, as a child I'm assuming it was most likely English but I don't know if I actually enjoyed English or if I enjoyed being good at English so that's been a topic of discussion in my head recently but I really enjoyed writing and I think I still do enjoy writing when I'm able to be creative with it not like writing papers,0.908
347.9,375.1, I am graduating from USC in a few months I'm currently applying to grad school for social work or marital and family therapist programs and I also work at USC SI TS organization so I do a lot of audio-visual troubleshooting but I'm not really the tech side in my opinion I feel like I'm more of the public relations side for my,0.841
394.6,423.9, I feel like at this point of time I've kind of stopped myself from trying to think of my dream job and because it's probably unrealistic but I think off the top of my head what I love to do is something that involves graphic design music people and food which are kind of very different things so I can't really think of a specific occupation that would include all four but those are four things in my life that I really enjoy and,0.894
424.6,429.4, and well-versed with but can't really make into a career besides graphic design,0.767
439.2,456.8, I'm definitely an extrovert but I think in recent years the past years I've become a lot more quiet and reserved although I still have no problems talking to people but yeah a little more Shire now,0.89
462.4,490.3, well two years ago I fell into depression for the first time so it's basically been two years of suddenly going from really outgoing and bubbling extroverted to someone who's really quiet and reserved that hasn't I think it's going to be a permanent personality change I now have come to peace with but yeah it took a lot,0.913
490.8,500.5, of getting used to when I had a lot of trouble interacting with people especially new people for the first time in life basically,0.898
509.5,538.2, my I don't have any siblings I just have my mom and my dad my relationship with both the both of them has changed very dramatically over the years growing up I was a daddy's girl and my mom and I argued a lot but around when I became a teenager that kind of flips very dramatically and I started fighting,0.913
538.3,566.4, with my dad a lot so by the time I graduated from high school my relationship with my dad was pretty pretty terrible not as terrible as as like relationships can be but in view of what our relationship was like when I was a child it was very very terrible so that's changed though I think that distance was good me going to college so I think,0.815
567.1,596.5, right now we're figuring out how it is for my dad and I to be like friends as like adults instead of you know a father and a child and my relationship with my mom is really good and I'm very independent from them though because that's how they raised me so I don't usually know how they're doing because I don't ask as much as I should but I've been trying to go home more lately now that I'm graduating and,0.899
597.5,603, it's starting to feel a lot more restful than it was before like when I was in high school,0.867
610.4,638.6, um these days I eat and nap I watch videos on YouTube I watch a lot of variety shows Korean variety shows because I enjoy music from Korean music so I've been catching up on a lot of shows and songs Oh music there you go I listen to a lot,0.634
638.8,642.1, of music from various genres,0.913
649.3,674.4, I'm very very good at controlling my temper I don't actually have that much of a temper there are very there's there are very few things in life that will automatically like trigger my anger and because there's so few of them when they do come up I'm very well-versed in maintaining whatever Behavior or you know,0.878
675.7,683.5, emotions that other people can see so yeah I don't really experience anger that often,0.888
698.9,725.9, I don't have a lot of arguments which is why I can't it's going to take me a little while to think of one but I think the last argument oh there you go last argument I had was with my Dad we were discussing politics which I have been carefully avoiding for the past few years because of the tumultuous political situation but basically he is,0.72
726.1,755.1, is like two generations removed for me so we have very very different views on different political issues and I'm also the more educated one in terms of like the current political climate and the current ideology is running around in the current influence of corrupt news and bias social media and Etc so I am the more I'm very objective and careful with my opinions and politics but he is like a,0.887
756,772.6, very very very very strong conservative which I'm fine with but I know for a fact that he's wrong about something so it's difficult sometimes to talk to him about politics without getting really really frustrated,0.793
786.9,814.7, I'd say the biggest example of that that's happened in the past couple of years is the way I handled I wouldn't say breaking up because we never started dating dating dating but I basically in the midst of my depression I blamed my depression on not wanting to go on dates more with one of my best friends and instead,0.901
815.8,844.9, instead of like taking responsibility and being like I just don't want to date you anymore I basically said the depression is not letting me do anything therefore we shouldn't date so I always wish I handled that better because I lost one of my best friends we haven't talked in we haven't seen each other physically since maybe May of last year we haven't talked like regularly and comfortably since December of last,0.86
845.4,870.5, two years ago now almost but I also lost a lot of other friends related to that related to him so sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I did that differently or if I had agreed to continue going on dates I think my life would have been very very different now but I think I've come to a point where I don't really regret any of it anymore it's just,0.909
871.8,882, sad and there are still some things that I would have done differently but at least now I know to do them differently in the future should a similar situation arise again,0.904
895.4,901.8, I think I feel guilty for not being a good friend I think I,0.886
903.2,908.2, I have succumbed to my depression a lot more than fighting it so,0.873
909.5,939.2, that's really affected the way I'm able to or I see I say I'm able the way I choose to socialize with people so I don't think I've been very considerate with some of my friends and have chosen to just like blame depression and blame a lack of emotion and lack of motivation to be a good friend instead of really you know like trihard or at least apologize,0.76
939.4,941.6, for not trying as hard,0.844
958.6,967.8, that's a big question I don't actually know what the hardest decision I've ever made was,0.877
983.3,988.8, it was probably probably choosing to,0.908
991.4,1021, now that wasn't that hard yeah I don't I I know for a fact that in my life I made a lot of difficult decisions but right now I can't think of one that I would personally consider being hard because I think after watching a lot of people in my life make actually hard decisions everything that I've made decisions on just doesn't seem like valid enough to like match up to,0.761
1022.3,1049.1, match up to the difficulty of their decision so I think I've lived a relatively simple life or I'm also just not very indecisive so decisions aren't that hard for me because I have my priorities very like instinctually ranked so I just go I'm very logical in that respect so I don't think most of my decisions have been hard,0.907
1061.4,1076.6, I think probably the thing with the guy talked about earlier for something I would have done differently I I honestly I almost regret saying yes to going on a date in the first place I think that was just--,0.849
1077.8,1104.2, I think things also would have been different if I had never even agreed to go on a date with him because like when I did get asked out by him I cried for like 48 hours because I knew there was literally just no going back from then and I had already guessed ahead of time that we wouldn't be friends at the end of this and self-fulfilling prophecy I guess but yeah I regret,0.893
1105.2,1107, I think I regret saying yes to him,0.814
1128.3,1145.1, I probably have many of these but they're like all very small like kind of oh cringe-worthy memories but a specific one,0.911
1147.3,1162.6, I think no I can't think of specific ones right now that are relevant to how I am as a person today,0.911
1163.9,1166, no I don't think I would erase anything,0.804
1171.6,1172.2, no,0.735
1183.4,1212.6, emotionless very unmotivated but that hasn't really been anything so it's just been a constant stream of kind of feeling purposeless I think I freaked out the other day because I realized I've been alive and breathing for so long and it's hard not to wonder what me at like 10:00 or me even like five years old would think if they met me as me too,0.844
1213,1242.4, right now and I think I'm just ready to graduate I don't feel like this excitement to graduate I just just this Readiness to not have to go to class and just not have to be constrained by things I don't see value in or enjoy not that that's all of school but there are enough things that distract me from what I deemed to be important but yeah just,0.9
1242.7,1243.9, T pretty mellow,0.663
1254.5,1281, that it's a constant stream of change I was really just doing really terrible around two weeks ago and just thinking about not necessarily thinking about suicide and thinking about hurting myself but I was thinking about how I understand why people hurt themselves and that was kind of a dark place to just be there and understand like oh like,0.912
1281.4,1306.6, all person and be like why would you like cut yourself or why would you hurt yourself makes no sense but I could understand the mentality and emotional state that people can be in that would prompt them to see that as like a logical thing so I was a pretty dark place so I guess my emotions have improved over the past two weeks to be a very rare to be in neutral ground again yeah,0.843
1314.4,1344, it's very easy if I commit to it but I have to have reason to commit to it so if I have an internship at 8:00 a.m. the next morning then I'm definitely going to be sleeping by 12 just out of commitment but if I I guess a good night sleep doesn't mean going to sleep early huh I think I'm it's very easy for me to get a good night sleep then cuz I'm perfectly fine sleeping for eight hours or more sometimes,0.791
1344.2,1352.1, X which I know isn't necessarily good but yeah I prioritize sleep a lot more than I did before,0.766
1361.5,1391, everything's internal for me so when I don't sleep well I feel a lot more sensitive inside and I think that people are judging me or they don't like me or they don't want me here so I'm a lot more self-deprecating internally when I don't sleep well and a lot more not like aggressively distrusting but like sadly distrusting of people including all my friends so but I'm,0.909
1391.3,1400.3, aware of that so when I'm like low on sleep and thinking like those things I'm like okay it's because you're tired so that's a good thing,0.892
1410.5,1414.9, yes I think it's very useful which is why I'm going into the profession,0.867
1421.7,1447.8, going into the profession of therapy I think depression has taught me that there p is a good thing and we're more than therapy the the skill of knowing how to actively listening to listen to someone and affirm them that they aren't crazy they are insane they aren't wrong for experiencing the things are experiencing I think that is,0.848
1448.8,1478.6, very a lot easier than people make it out to be and I think it's kind of sad that therapy as like as a concept everyone assumes it's as to be done in a professional manner which is great yeah but like we don't have time for every single person to get to get hooked up with a professional mental health therapist like people just need to,0.775
1478.7,1508.5, learn how to like be a listening ear to each other and be vulnerable and just like encourage people and express affection and I think of everyone behaved the way that therapists behave people wouldn't need their p as much and I think therapy is never the the like the end goal for someone I think a therapist should be encouraged,0.774
1508.6,1515.7, then that person to like find intimacy and Solace and their close friends and loved ones and,0.676
1516.7,1527.6, yeah a therapist should never be someone's like and her like sole source of confiding and because that would be very inefficient,0.873
1536.5,1561.3, it's a 10 because 20 years ago I would only be a baby but 10 years ago I would be 12 I think I would I would like warn myself not worn myself but let myself know like hey you know if your your value does not lie in the grades you get your value doesn't lie in what you can do and how athletic you are,0.737
1562.2,1591.4, because you're going to experience a lot of insecurity in middle school when he stopped automatically getting A's and you stop being the best and things and that's okay that you're not the best no one's ever asked you to be the best so just like if there's anything you want to be that you should be the best in its character so work I'm being kind and gentle and patient,0.907
1592.1,1603, to listen well and to be slow to speak to be objective to be considerate to be generous and to be just um very openly loving,0.876
1628.2,1644.2, I can't I don't really remember I I don't know what really happy really means anymore so it's really hard for me to think,0.904
1645.6,1662.8, back to a time other than okay last summer I do remember experiencing like like the heights of Joy but I'm pretty sure in the past six months I have been really happy at least once but I can't remember any of it,0.913
1664,1664.4, yeah,0.74
1683.7,1710.6, I have one of my best friend's is named Tammy and the two of us met on a missions trip two years ago over the summer and we only spent five weeks together but we've been in a long-distance friendship for two years now over two years and it's been very very very encouraging because we're very long you know she's seven hours,0.865
1710.8,1740, so way but the fact that we're like still speaking very regularly to each other and just being very open and honest and sharing each other's burdens is just been a real source of Hope for me because I've experienced a lot of broken friendships here at USC but this having Champion my life it's like oh like it is possible for someone to like want to be friends with you,0.847
1740.7,1755.6, bite all these obstacles and you're worth fighting for Tammy's been one of my biggest supporters in this time of depression and yeah I just loved her a lot,0.836
1768.6,1770.8, I think she would say that,0.796
1772.9,1775.6, I love people and that,0.805
1776.8,1785.4, I'm I care about people's people's Holiness more than care about yeah,0.881
