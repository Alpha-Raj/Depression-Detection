86.8,107.7, initially I really like the weather but not anymore right now because it's really cold aside from that I feel like there's a lot of new things that I am able to experience here that I couldn't in Asia because Asia is quite a sheltered place and I would say the government is a lot more,0.889
109.1,125.6, you know crazy so like in America you see a lot more different people and a lot of different things that I have never liked I guess it's only things I seen the movie and then I see them in real like real life and Lala and I'm like wow that's that's real,0.844
135.9,163.8, well it is actually in my opinion quite cold here in general I thought that people consider Ela warm but that doesn't seem to be my experience so far aside from that I guess it's a safety issue because I grew up in Singapore in Singapore is quite a safe place in my opinion actually one of the safest places so maybe I don't feel as secure walking down the streets here then I would,0.913
163.9,164.7, in Asia,0.728
177.4,181.1, not as often I'm not a big travel person,0.865

211,211.6, oh,0.674
214.5,235.4, I guess going into college it's really memorable for me because I completely went to a different country and there's not a lot of people who actually I knew when I came here at all actually I probably only knew one other person so I really had to start anew and it was the first time where I was truly alone,0.888
242.8,249.5, I love math a lot I love it so much I'm not good at it but it makes me really happy,0.835
257.7,263.9, what do I do now I'm a Psychology major so usually it's just textbook reading not a lot of math,0.913
277.7,293.3, I would love to be a plastic surgeon but I just feel like that would be that's a really long and hard career path to achieve and to get to but maybe maybe if I really work hard I could get to it,0.903
301.7,325.3, um I think I'm like kind of like in the complete middle of that I am outgoing when I have to be so when I'm outside meeting new people I have no like problems talking to them being comfortable around new people however I do like enjoy reserving myself just being more quiet too,0.909
331.4,342.9, well I feel like I'm most comfortable just being with small group of people or being alone and just being I just find that a more comfortable environment,0.902
350,378.9, it's amazing I have the best family in the whole entire world my parents are so loving and they're both happily happily happily married to each other I think they've been together for just about 30 years now I love him so so much I would do anything for my parents my family they mean the world to me and I have older brother and I love him so much to obviously we were kind of like if you were we were young because he would bully me and I would like just be a little whiny baby,0.888
379.5,389.2, now that we're both older I feel like he really takes care of me and I really can tell that even though he's a person who can't show a lot of emotion that he really cares about me,0.839
397.2,419.5, to relax I like to just spend time at home I often like to watch the Youtube videos just any thing whatever I'm up for horror movies also help me relax odd enough aside from that I guess arts and crafts working drawing doing stuff and tasks that don't require a lot of thinking,0.766
427.4,446.4, I actually think I'm terribly bad at it I don't like to admit that at all I like to think I'm a super chill person because I want to be but I'm not chill at all so no I'm probably on a scale from 1 being really bad at keeping my temper to 10 being really good at keeping my temper I'm probably like a three,0.902
455.1,484.7, um oh last time I argue is someone's probably when I argued with my boyfriend and it was just I mean worry rat I worry a lot about people I love and I care about their safety so much be so I was just mad because he doesn't live in the country he's in Singapore so I was just mad that like you know he would go out at night and then like he would like you know get intoxicated go home and he would just fall asleep and then,0.802
484.9,496.4, I would be really really mad because then I'd be like you know I want to know that you're safe and that he understands that to so like it wasn't really an argument but that's as close as it gets I don't argue with people often,0.766
512.7,535.5, for all situations relating to my boyfriend I wish I could be more chill with him because I understand that he loves me a lot and like I understand that he cares for me so much and like I should be lucky and happy that I'm just with like a great guy like him but I feel like I'm not as chill so like I create unrealistic expectations sometimes and I,0.82
535.7,565.2, is this as it's happening or I can mad at him for like small things just because he won't text me when he gets home which I think is just like a creepy mom thing to do so I wish I could be more chill about it because he's a grown man like he's he's legal he's like you know he can do anything he can do anything he wants your like when you reach that threshold of age like past 21 year old enough to do anything so I just feel like I should not be so Mom on him I should just let him do what he wants,0.884
565.6,578.5, give him his independence trust him and not be so insecure however I just can't keep my chill when it comes to him because I care for him too much but I hope that I can be more chill and I would really like to change that about myself,0.866
597.3,603.3, Paul I think one thing that does make me guilty is the fact that,0.891
607.8,618.4, when I when I went to China to visit my grandma for the last time I don't think I spend as much time with her as I should have,0.836
620.2,625.4, yeah now I can't so makes me quite guilty but,0.856
626.9,628.6, she was happy,0.808
643.8,650, yeah I can I just I'm thinking it was the hardest decision I've ever had to make,0.747
659.5,680.5, oh yeah answer that earlier about I think my regret and guilt comes together so I would like say my grandma I regret just not spending as much time with her like I know she was happy and I did spend time with her I just feel like I wish I'd spent more time with her but that's a common regret for people I think,0.866
695.7,696.7, hmm,0.668
698.4,708.7, I don't think I want to erase any event from my memory I think generally there's nothing so bad that I don't want to remember it so yeah I'll keep everything,0.893
718.4,720.8, no I have it I know a lot of people who have though,0.845
729,734.6, I did not join the military so I was not an age,0.86
741.3,741.8, well,0.781
743.2,750.1, I didn't listen the military so no I did not decide to enlist,0.843
755.9,759.2, I didn't enlist so I would know maybe,0.816
767.2,771.3, no only in movies,0.911
785.2,791.7, I've never joined the military so it was very easy because I was not in the military,0.852
803.2,804.8, I never joined the military,0.86
815.3,821.2, I did not join the military so it didn't change me because I was never in the military,0.819
832.6,843.7, I'm okay I've actually been feeling kind of like oddly uninterested in a lot of things but I think it's just because school pressure stress Etc just builds up and I just kind of don't like it that's it,0.904
847.5,875.5, noticed any changes yeah I just I don't I'm not as excited to do something stuff and like excited to do things that I maybe would have been okay with doing I wouldn't say I don't like things I enjoy to do before how what am I trying to say I'm trying to say that like all the things I used to enjoy I still enjoy but some of the things that I just thought were mediocre I now like really don't care about,0.868
877.1,888.9, I think that's honestly a hormonal thing because you know when you're a female you're home alone School weird and you know you I always go through these kind of dips in like a certain time of the month,0.862
898.1,912, falling asleep is the hardest for me but once I start sleeping I can get a pretty good night's sleep falling asleep though it can take up to an hour even so it's moderately hard,0.912
920,937.8, I think I actually do well when I don't sleep well because my it's not often that I don't so my body still has like saved up energy to like kind of boost me forward and it puts me in some weird survival mode so I'm able to really actually just even be better than when I slept well,0.829
948.6,966.1, um yes I think it is I know several friends who go to therapy who think it's useful and I am a psychology psych psych major so we do learn in class that there is usefulness and therapy if it's like the right kind the right things,0.89
980.7,1007.7, I wasn't born 20 years ago but 10 years ago I would tell myself to not be a man don't be a man was what I would have told myself and I mean that as like I was a super tomboy just about 10 years ago and I just feel like you know what I should have never done that that's weird I bought like the boys school uniform I wore a hat every day I was kind of weird it was it was weird and I'm not it's not,0.889
1007.9,1015, my proudest moments I probably would have told myself like hey don't do the Tomboy face skip it skip it,0.824
1027.9,1055.8, when I called my boyfriend we call like every other day every longest would be like once a week I mean yeah but usually it's pretty often we call and every time I call him makes me really really happy and I also was really happy when I heard about my parents they went to watch a movie and my dad said they'd had a lot of fun and I was pretty happy about that I was I like you and they go out and they still go on dates together it makes me so happy,0.878
1062,1062.4, yeah,0.723
1071.8,1101.1, I would say my parents both my mom and dad have both been really positive for me I feel like they're like a good amount of encouraging you know they never put me down they like teach me how to chill and relax more because I'm kind of more of an uptight person they're really supportive never likely creepy parents who call me all the time they've always given,0.89
1101.2,1108.4, me freedom and I don't know I just feel like they taught me a lot and I want to raise my children like they raised me one day,0.786
1116.4,1116.8, oh,0.775
1120.1,1149.7, they were probably say currently not down is probably exactly what they would say like the phrase not down as like modern-day slang describing someone who is not down to party and whatever because I don't like partying I'm just kind of a stay-at-home person to each their own really but unlike the only person my friend who doesn't like to sew and the not down,0.893
1150.3,1168.8, aside from that I think they would probably just say I'm like they were probably think I'm chill or or confident or they have like I'm pretty like together one of my friend like I keep myself collected hold myself strong so words along those lines,0.861
1184.4,1213.3, I really enjoy online shopping so recently I bought some fun stuff online so like I bought like nice clothes and like nice little like off the shoulder top and everything and clothing shopping for clothes makes me really happy it hurts my bank account number but it's like one of you like when I finished an exam or something like that I like to reward Myself by allowing,0.779
1213.5,1217.7, myself to buy something and that made me quite happy,0.866
1227.8,1229.9, I didn't say anything you can keep going,0.908
1241.7,1243, having a great family,0.904
1245.8,1264.4, I'm really proud of that if you can even be proud of that I am proud or more like grateful but the fact that I have such like amazing parents and surrounded by such like like just my family is really supportive and I'm proud to call them my family proud to have them,0.887
