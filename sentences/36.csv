17.3,21.8, please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential,0.885
25,26.9,yes,0.852
35.6,36.9, am I supposed to ask something,0.805
54.2,56.9, I supposed to talk about something I'm kind of confused,0.732
61.6,62.1, okay,0.866
65.3,75.3,okay I see I'm doing pretty well I'm kind of tired kind of sleepy I had a couple midterms today,0.908
78.1,90.1, those were stressful but they're over now and I'm going to visit my friend this weekend and New Orleans for Mardi grass so I guess I'm I'm excited about that so pretty good,0.834
97.2,122.7, I grew up abroad in a country called Malta it's off the coast of Italy and I lived there for 10 years and then I moved to America when I was 10 and I lived in Florida so that's kind of where I've been living since then so I guess like half of my home is in malta hadn't half of where I'm from is in Florida yeah,0.904
129.5,159.5, Allah I guess the weather is really nice especially coming from places that are really warm it's nice to keep my same wardrobe kind of wear whatever I want to be able to wear without worrying about like the cold or bunch of different like winter jackets also there is a lot of stuff to do it's a really busy City I feel like I've had a lot of opportunities to,0.905
159.6,169, go explore and do things and business opportunities for work that I haven't been able or I don't think I would be able to have in a lot of other places,0.804
177.4,206.9, I guess the people are it's a little half and half I guess some of the people in La that I've experienced especially in the entertainment industry when I have been like working for like production companies and whatnot seem to be a little full of themselves and a little superficial and it seems like you can't really have a real conversation with them with,0.872
207.9,222.5, without them trying to hide themselves up or talk about how amazing there are and it feels like there's no real substance to a lot of conversations I've had that's not true for all the people and I Lie by any means but I feel like that's one of my least favorite things is people like that in LA,0.786
235.4,261.8, I used to in high school I went to traveling boarding school so we went to Argentina for a semester and then we went to Uruguay for a bit and Bhutan for a bit and Thailand and before that because of my mom's work I would go to a lot of places in Europe a lot but that was mostly in like elementary through High School recently I guess,0.817
262.3,271.2, I have been doing more local traveling like visiting to see friends and Chicago or Louisiana or New York but nowhere really abroad,0.874
275.2,303.5,I think it's especially when I'm going to visit friends it's really fun to see their take on a city and see what they think is interesting and fun to do and kind of explore new things that I haven't been able to experience before and also I find it really interesting to kind of see how the mindset in people and like what people value just kind of differs from place to place,0.911
308.3,309.9, I'd like to hear about one of your trips,0.842
312.5,340.8, one of my recent trips over winter break I went to Ireland to visit my dad and his side of the family and I hadn't seen my dad in person and seven years and I hadn't seen my our side of the family and 10 years so when I went to go to Ireland it was my first time in like a decade so it's my first time really remembering it I suppose and it was it was a really amazing place it was beautiful the people there were so friendly it was so nice to see,0.83
341,348.9, family again I felt so welcomed and secure it it was really a great experience and I really hope I get to go back soon hopefully over spring break,0.901
354.2,354.3, what,0.596
363.8,364.4, okay,0.723
369.6,399.2, I think theater I'm minoring in theater now and it's just fun I don't know it's like a hobby I guess it doesn't feel like it's a pressured curriculum I guess is what I like about it and it's like a fun way to like destress kind of like express yourself so it was my favorite major in high school I mean favorite subject and,0.893
399.4,405, school and it's probably one of my favorite classes to take still in college,0.856
412.2,439.8, well I'm a cognitive science major and I'm a Theatre minor so with cognitive science I guess I'm just taking classes in both of those for now I have a couple research assistant positions and Labs on campus and I hope to get a master's in industrial organizational psychology I am hoping to also work this summer as in like human resources or something for a business,0.91
440.9,442.2, I don't know it just seems interesting,0.841
452.7,453.4, awesome job,0.913
454.7,474.5, something else I guess if I got really good at it may be either writing or acting I haven't really thought about them as more than just Hobbies but if you can like make a living off your hobby and make that your job I think that's great,0.813
478.8,508.4, um I guess it kind of depends on the situation I feel like sometimes in social situations I feel incredibly awkward and have no idea what to say but I feel like most of the time like more than half of the time I feel pretty outgoing I feel comfortable initiating conversations or just like thinking of stuff to say or kind of building off what other people are saying,0.911
509.4,511.8, I think that's most of the time yeah,0.891
517.2,540.8, I guess I just I enjoy getting to know people and I think it's each person is like a really obviously like complex human being and I feel like everybody just has something really like interesting about themselves and I think it's really cool to see someone's face light up when they start talking about something they're passionate about and I really like having those kinds of conversations with people,0.799
545.8,575.4, with my mom she her and my dad got divorced when I was maybe a year old and she remarried when I was two and then she and my stepdad divorced when I was 10 so I don't really I haven't really had any contact with my stepdad since then but I think throughout like my childhood I still had like a pretty good contact,0.798
575.6,605.3, I died but he after he my mom got divorced he moved back to Ireland so I I had kind of a like a wavering kind of relationship with him I guess it wasn't like super regular visits like their phone calls were like pretty frequent and visits were here and there but my relationship with my mom had always been pretty steady I suppose and especially since going away to college I think it's improved there's still like some strain and the relationship there,0.906
605.5,616.1, I guess but with when I recently saw my dad for the first time in a while it didn't really feel strained or awkward at all so that was nice,0.851
620.2,638.6,um probably watch Netflix find a new show on Netflix to watch or a journal sometimes or I just start writing one of those things,0.792
642.6,672.6, I think I'm pretty good at not getting angry at people even if I feel angry I don't I think it takes a lot for me to lash out at someone I feel like I'm not really past Progressive either I think I just try to like just go with however people are acting unless it's really really getting under my skin which doesn't happen too often but as far as,0.887
672.6,692.8, as my temper goes in terms of like getting upset or like crying I feel like I'm pretty emotional in that sense and it's it's I guess more of a challenge to if I'm feeling really like overwhelmed and like a sad or upsetting way it's harder for me to resist crying,0.903
702.4,730.7, I think I want to say it wasn't a huge argument it was yesterday morning with my roommate I really suck at waking up on time and I had to be up at like 7:00 a.m. but I was really sleep deprived because I had gone to bed at 4 a.m. so I was really tired and I had like midterms that day and I was super groggy so I set like a bunch of alarms starting at like 6:30 like every five minutes and when,0.852
730.8,760.7, I got out of bed she was like my roommate was like out of bed doing her makeup and she was like oh well I would have gone back to sleep if all of your alarms hadn't woken me up and I could tell she was really annoyed with me and I felt pretty bad and I started to apologize to her and say hey I'm sorry like I said I've so many alarms like I started out by asking her like hey ones your midterm today and she she told me it was at 1 p.m. and she would have been able to sleep in if it wasn't for my alarms and,0.893
760.8,770.4, I just got really flustered and then I like I'm going again I'm not like a super confrontational person and I don't really I try not to get really angry so I just kind of left,0.757
789.6,819.5, okay I guess one thing I could have handled differently this was like a while ago maybe not like this past December but the December before that my boyfriend the time and I broke up but I started out by I wasn't sure if I wanted to break up with him but I told him I wanted a break like for a month like sort things out and see how I felt and at the end of it like we both ended up feeling,0.896
819.7,837.6, kind of the same way that we should break up so it inevitably ended in a breakup and I wish I would have I guess just broken up with him on the spot instead of leaving the break open because I think it made things more painful and more ambiguous so I wish yeah I probably could have done that differently,0.905
852.8,853.6, um,0.747
855.6,862, probably the fact that I ate half a box of Girl Scout Cookies by myself last night,0.85
872.2,875.5, the hardest decision I've ever had to make,0.897
879.3,906.5, probably I'm a really indecisive person in general so even deciding on what the hardest dish is decision I had to make is hard to decide on I guess one of them would be deciding where to come to school I really would like for college I was really down between USC and UCLA and I just could not decide like and I'm from Florida so again like I had no idea what the universities were like in person so I spent so much time,0.852
906.7,926, trying to figure out which university I went to obviously I made the right decision but that took a lot that was like a lot of emotions especially with my mom putting on pressure and me because I had also gotten into UC Berkeley and she really wanted me to go there and I'd like didn't so I guess it was just like hard to decide with her putting pressure on me too,0.862
930.1,930.5, okay,0.725
937,963.3, something I regret well this semester I'm taking a class called sensation perception and I really regret not dropping that before the add/drop period because our exam in that class our entire grade in the entire class is determined by three exams two midterms and a final so last yesterday morning was my exam and,0.903
963.4,978.1, I probably could have studied better I definitely could have prepared for it more the questions were simple but I just didn't know the material and there was a lot of it so I regret not studying more and taking more time and not procrastinating,0.868
983.8,994, something I wish I could erase from my memory,0.868
997.9,999.3, probably,0.772
1001.6,1028, The Break-Up I had with my ex or like maybe the last half of our relationship that was just Rocky and it was like I don't feel like I regret a lot of things or like wish I could get rid of a lot of things but I guess it was it's not really so painful now but at the time it really hurt and it like hurt me for a while so I'm not sure but I guess yeah,0.856
1035.6,1038.9, no I haven't,0.882
1046.1,1075.7, um pretty tired it's I don't know how to explain it it's like tired but I have energy but I still feel like exhausted I don't know how to explain it it's like I'll like go through the day because there's just like so much stuff that needs to get done and I don't feel like drained or like I'm slugging through it but I just feel like I definitely haven't been getting as much sleep as I usually do I need like nine or ten hours to function because I have the brain and sleep,0.864
1075.9,1105.7, needs of a child apparently so I guess I've been really really tired and I feel like it's kind of clouded by thinking a little bit like in class I'll just find myself like zoning out so other than that I feel like I have like a good handle on things like I know what I'm doing I know like what my goals are like I'm working towards different things so I don't I feel like I'm not really stressed out but I would like more,0.668
1105.8,1106.3, sleep,0.769
1110.8,1140.4, um yeah I yeah yeah I think so I think especially in like the last month I would say is when like my behavior and mood and thoughts kind of started to shift I would say for the better before that I feel like I had gotten into a place where I felt like things just didn't matter like there was no purpose anything like there just wasn't like an actual,0.865
1141.1,1170.4, meaning like people sucked like everybody is just kind of a shitty person and everyone's only looking out for themselves and I really didn't like thinking that way but I didn't know another way to think and I think after I had my break and winter break and was able to go see family in Ireland and see like my friends from high school back home before I went to Ireland and then I came back home especially I think Ireland was a big part of it I guess I started,0.846
1170.5,1198.7, feeling like people could be more genuine and like I actually had a purpose like something I wanted to do like I had I have goals like I know like each day I have something to do that gives me like joy and fulfillment I suppose and I think just overall everything like the like the thoughts in my head have just been more positive and more just like but the more positive outlook I guess yeah,0.899
1209.8,1229.1, I guess it it depends usually I feel like it's pretty easy because especially recently because I like exhaust myself during the day and by the end of it I just feel really tired so it's pretty easy to drift off I guess,0.906
1233.8,1263.3, well I'd say a little loopy I guess I'm not really particularly irritable well maybe a little bit but I don't think I show that I think I might get internally irritable or I might feel like a little anxious but I think for the most part it just feels like there's a little fog in my brain that I can't entirely get rid of so I'm not,0.827
1263.6,1272.4, thinking a hundred percent it's not like super super bad like maybe I'm at like 95% brain functioning but it just it just feels a little bit off,0.812
1284.1,1310.2, I have mixed feelings I've been to therapy a couple different times with different therapists and sometimes I feel like I've gotten nothing out of it and sometimes I've like felt and not worse in general but like like my shut thoughts and shifted in like a not-so-great way and I've had some times when I feel like I've talked to therapists and they've helped me like work through something,0.851
1310.4,1313.4, that's been bothering me so I think it just depends,0.858
1321,1342.9, I guess maybe it's the connection you have between yourself and the therapist or there certain way there are certain like psychological perspective or whatever kind of method they want to use I feel like some methods work great for some people and not so great for others so I think if there's a mismatch there I probably wouldn't be as effective,0.838
1356.9,1371.4, I guess yeah no that makes sense maybe I mean I was pretty young but I guess I would have told myself too,0.889
1374.1,1403.7, I guess start becoming more independent I feel like I'm like a really independent person at this point in my life and I think that started in high school I had to learn how to do like a lot of things for myself my mom was like a way for a bit so I just kind of had to I was with relatives still but it was just different and I think before that when I was younger I wished that my mom would do a lot of things for me that I felt,0.868
1403.9,1433.4, like she should be doing and I felt kind of annoyed I guess that I saw like my other friends parents doing things for them that my mom was probably just like too busy to do and I wish I could have just told myself like it's like it's not her fault and I don't think I blamed her for doing it at the time but it's not her fault and you just kind of have to figure out how to do things on your own because you're going to later anyway,0.789
1444.2,1445.1, do do do,0.744
1447.1,1476.3, I can't think of I'm sure I've been happy since then but like one thing I guess that comes to mind is when I went to Ireland and I was visiting my cousins who were like all my age one of them took me out to a couple bars in the area and I we were and it was like with my cousin and like a couple of his friends and I was just having such like a great time like I was just so happy I was on cloud nine I was just surrounded by such,0.824
1476.5,1486.7, like people who I was just having great conversation with like everyone was just like so friendly and so nice and so welcoming and I just had a really great time and I was really happy,0.878
1496,1497.9, it's been a positive influence in her life,0.616
1502.7,1503.9, I guess,0.774
1508.6,1538.1, I would say my mom I've I feel like I there's no way I would be like the person I am today without like I'm sure like the way she raised me I feel like in a lot of ways I'm very different from her but I feel like there are a lot of things she taught me that I feel like a lot of people my age don't fully grasp yet so,0.89
1538.6,1544.9, I'm really grateful to have gained that kind of Outlook and perspective on life from such a young age,0.742
1554.5,1583.6, probably really empathetic really caring sometimes to caring like assuming the best in people even when I probably shouldn't that's something I'm working on I guess really like warm and friendly definitely energetic and enthusiastic yeah oh and tend to,0.908
1584.3,1589.5, definitely say my friends would say I have trouble making decisions and I overthink things way too much,0.803
1603.4,1606.3, really recently what is this weekend,0.861
1611.5,1641.1, I guess my my diverse range of like interests and skills I guess I feel like there aren't a lot of people that are interested in like the same sorts of things I do because they don't really will like they're like there aren't a lot of people that are interested in the same things I do like all at once because the crossover,0.885
1641.3,1652.8, isn't necessarily like super obvious at first but I guess I'm just really proud of my ability to have like a unique perspective on things,0.792
1657.7,1658, okay,0.735
