107.7,131.3, I would say the thing that I least like about La is the sidewalks because it's really bumpy and all over the place there's a bunch of cracks on the floors and things like that and my hometown it was like very very like plane so I like that because I do skate around to places so sometimes it gets difficult to do that here,0.817

209.2,216.8, and then I like the city as well it was different from mine so I just I guess I like the differences that I noticed,0.829
229.9,240.2, I guess in that trip at Notre Dame the most memorable experience was getting to see the what is it called,0.891
242.4,252.7, the church that they had I really heard a lot of good comments about it and it looked really amazing when I went inside so I really like that setting it was pretty cool,0.904
261.1,264.1, I feel like it's always been math growing up,0.868
266.1,288.1, I just know I like the complexity that it has and there's always like multiple ways to get an answer it's just depends on the path you take but I feel like now it has slowly changed to chemistry since it has like Applied Biology and Mathematics in it while also like including some other stuff that I really enjoy so I would say chemistry,0.908
293.2,308.7,I'm a student so I'm trying to get a degree in biology Bachelors of Science so I could go to medical school so that's my goal as of now,0.823
324.8,348.3, well my dream job has I guess mostly been wanting to become a pediatrician but if that route didn't go as I planned or circumstances to allow me to do that I would say teaching would be my second choice just because I enjoy helping others in the sense that I share my knowledge with them,0.897
356.9,370.4, I would say I fall more under the shy side but in terms of like being the first person to talk it I feel like it would probably be me,0.88
377,406.7, I don't know I feel like I have had numerous jobs customer service jobs that kind of helped me like go away from the shy side and get out of my way to interact with customers just to provide them the better service that they need so I feel like customer service has helped in that but in regards of like meeting people on an any day occasion it's not usually like the first thing that I'd go up and do but the and,0.834
406.9,413, summer service or in a job I'd probably be the first one to smile the first one to talk or things like that,0.843
423.8,426.3, it's complicated,0.754
427.5,446.2, I feel like that's the word that sums it all I feel like the era that my parents grew up is completely different from now so there's a lot of like conflicting topics or things that they try to educate us on and things that we don't agree with so it's just like a clash of cultures in a way,0.908
456.2,469.6, I would say that the unhealthy thing that I do is I start eating is a bad habit of mine or sometimes when I when I try to relax I just take walks or go on my skateboard and roam around campus,0.815

536.2,541.6, mmm,0.887
548.7,572.9, I guess that's situation is the first that comes up I probably should have reacted nicer in the sense that I could have changed the tone of my voice since I was a little harsh when I spoke up about it and told them about it about what I did and didn't agree with and I feel like that's what I guess kind of made them,0.767
574.3,584.8, act the way they did in the sense that they were a little nicer to me after that and it shouldn't have been that occasion they should have been the same without me having to raise my voice or anything,0.904
589.3,590.9, what's up,0.386
594.3,595.3, I guess,0.78
601.4,618, I'm not sure what I feel guilty about I guess the study habits that I have and I guess this competitive drive that everyone has in college that sometimes you forget about friends or communication that is kind of like I,0.811
619.2,627.3, I kind of feel like it's people's fall of not doing stuff but it's usually mine so I guess that's what I feel guilty about,0.805
640.1,649.7, let's say probably my short life that I've had I would say choosing what,0.783
650.8,680.5, profession to well like what educational path I wanted to take in regards to like what university I should attend when my parents wanted me to attend a certain University and I chose another University or the fact that my parents don't want me to take the profession of going to medical school and and me deciding to stick with that I guess that was the hardest decision just I mean it's not fulfilled yet but I feel,0.817
680.7,683.2, like that's the path that the stuff,0.792
697.5,725.1, I guess the thing I regret is my housing situation I feel like I'm not the best roomy or person to live with just because my schedule is all over the place and I feel like I've put my roommate in a situation where she has to wake up at 5:00 in the morning because I have morning shifts or she has to hear like multiple alarms because,0.88
725.2,746.2, can't wake up to my first so I feel like I regret saying yes knowing that all of these things would have cure and didn't think about what she how she would feel at the end of it so I feel like that's one of the things that I should have done stayed on a solo room or something like that,0.78
759.8,761.6, that's a hard question,0.913
764.9,767.4, I don't,0.819
776.5,799.3, I I feel like I wouldn't want anything erase from my memory just because I feel like all the events that have happened to me or significant to who I have become so I would probably say that I don't want any of them to be erased whether it was bad or good I feel like everything happened for a reason and it made me who I am,0.837
803.2,805.8,no,0.861

845.7,874, I guess I initially started like the cadet machir feeling really excited eager to learn and like ready for any challenges academic challenges or obstacles to come my way and I feel like I've slowly progressed to become indifferent to whatever circumstances happen whether I'm behind on studying behind on homework or things like that so I feel like that's one of the things that has happened,0.767
874.2,874.5, and,0.785
885.7,909.3, it's easy in the sense that I can I decide when I want to go to sleep but I usually feel like I should get things done like certain amount of homework done before I go to sleep just because L like let me peacefully go to sleep instead of having to worry while I'm falling asleep that I didn't do this or I should have continued or things like that,0.896
916.8,941.3, it depends on the day and how many hours they get I feel sometimes I wake up really eager and full of energy and then obviously later in the day I'll crash and like feel really tired or sometimes I'll wake up for The Grouchy or moodier really sensitive so I feel like it depends on the number of hours that I get and at what point of my sleep I wake up,0.909

973.3,977, I didn't fully say everything that you asked me to,0.913
992,1012.1, I don't know if I feel like the one advice that I'd give to myself is to actually pay attention during my whole academic years just because now I could have really used those hours of studying then instead of trying to cram everything that I should have learned back then to now so I would say that,0.909
1018.8,1019.8, when was the last time,0.913
1022.8,1023.3, um,0.746
1025.7,1034.7, I think I woke up in a good mood today so I feel like earlier this morning I felt really really happy maybe yeah it was I would say today,0.912
