25,25.5,yes,0.752
36,37.8, pretty good A little tired,0.862
48.2,52.8, I'm originally from Roslyn which is on Long Island New York,0.749
61.1,72.4, I really like the weather because I really hate the cold so snow in New York is not really for me and I like the people there are a lot more laid back than they are in New York,0.842
82.2,95.2, there's a lot of traffic compared to Long Island I'm not from the city Long Island's more like suburbs so there's like one hour for rush hour but here there's just traffic all hours of the day which is super annoying,0.835
107.6,119.1, not really just to and from school but I haven't really been on a vacation in a while because school is so far and the weather is nice here so I don't really feel the need to go away,0.862
129.5,141.2, I like to see the culture of wherever I travel to just kind of compare it to like my daily life and I like to just get away for a little bit,0.872
142.5,143.2, and relax,0.745
152.6,172.5, my most recent trip was last year spring break I went to Cabo with my friends and that was a lot of fun because it was the first vacation that I took with my friends and not with my family so we kind of just hung out went to the beach went out to dinner a lot and it was like a nice break from school so it was a lot of fun,0.869
187.8,204.5, well okay um well on vacation we jumped off a cliff which is probably super dangerous but it was a lot of fun they took us on like a little boat to just like a rock cliff in the middle of the water and we just jumped off which was fun,0.903
213.7,215.5, my favorite subject was biology,0.827
221.2,228.2, I'm majoring in health and human Sciences some on the pre-med track hoping to go to medical school and be a surgeon,0.769
251.2,254.7, well I didn't answer but ideally,0.863
256.1,269.7, I don't know I mean I kind of do want to be a surgeon I did want to be a lawyer and then I decided that that wasn't for me and I wanted to be a surgeon so I switched and just decided to do that so I guess that's my dream job,0.875
272.6,273.2, but yeah,0.846
281.9,305, probably more outgoing I think I used to be a little more outgoing when I was younger but now I've kind of dialed it back a little just because of like the settings that I'm in like in the hospital I kind of am just shadowing or like volunteering so I don't want to overstep or see him not professional so I've kind of like toned it down but I would say more outgoing than quiet for sure,0.909
313,324.2, I mean I like to talk a lot I have a lot of friends I mean I grew up playing sports so you kind of had to be outgoing because you were on a team with a bunch of girls,0.905
326.1,343.5, we had practice like every day you had to be like vocal and communicate with your teammates and it was kind of just like being part of a team I guess that also made me more outgoing because no one really wants to talk to someone who doesn't want to talk back to them I really interact or be like fun,0.765
351.9,356.2, I'm not super close with my family I my parents got,0.804
357.5,387.1, technically separated not divorced yet when I was in 6th grade and they were fighting for a long time like didn't get divorce until I was a junior in high school so I wasn't super close at them because they were always fighting and I didn't really agree with a lot of their morals and values and just like who they were as people so I lived with my mom most of the time growing up from when they got divorced up until my senior year of high school and then I got in a fight with my mom so I moved in with my dad and now I,0.693
387.3,401, of it by dad like when I go home on brakes but I mean like I have a fine relationship I talked to them both almost every day I like to call them all I'm walking but yeah,0.797
402.8,405.2, I like both of them they just don't like each other at all,0.821
415.5,445.2, I don't really have that much time to relax in school because I'm super busy with work and just like extracurricular things but when I do have time to relax like if I finally have a free weekend where I don't have to be studying for a test I usually would like to just go to lunch with my friends just use it like a quick thing or I mean I like to watch TV a lot like I'm really into Grey's Anatomy and a bunch of doctors nurses so I like to watch those because I don't really have time during the year,0.824
446.2,447.8, while I'm studying to do that,0.876
456.9,480.9, pretty good I would say I used to be super impulsive and kind of not like lash out but I wouldn't really be able to control it I would say like I would talk back a lot but now I'm a lot better I kind of weigh the costs and benefits of my head of talking back to someone or like speaking up in a situation where I probably shouldn't,0.829
482.5,488.5, and now like it's not hard for me to hold back what I have to say if the costs outweigh the benefits,0.777
497.9,526, the last time I argued with someone was maybe like a month ago I had an argument with my roommate because she had made a big deal about having crumbs everywhere just like on the counters and that she couldn't cook because it was so dirty and then we had people over to our apartment for a pregame and it was her friends not mine like at all it was for like before her invite and the apartment was disgusting,0.913
526.3,556, and there's like black all over the floor so I just texted her the next day and was like you really shouldn't have left it like that especially after you made such a big deal about how you couldn't cook if the apartment was gross so I kind of just brought that up and she kind of like freaked out a little and started crying and freaking out because I guess she doesn't take confrontation well that I mean it ended up being fine like I wasn't mad I was just pointing out that I thought she should have cleaned better and she kind of took it in a different direction,0.86
556.1,557.3, but I mean it's fine now,0.86
589.3,617.5, in terms of research last semester I was doing research on campus with the professor and I just didn't understand what he was talking about it all like I couldn't have explained the research in a medical school interview so I kind of thought it was a waste of my time but I did feel bad because the like graduate student had invested a lot of his time to try to teach me and I just wasn't getting it so I probably should have told him in person because I knew for a while I wasn't going to be continuing to the next,0.738
617.6,633.1, semester but instead I emailed him and just said that I didn't have time even though like I probably did I kind of lied because I just couldn't do it anymore and didn't think that that would really offend him if I said that I just didn't have time to do the research anymore,0.869
649.3,677.8, for next year I am not living with my current roommate again because she has a boyfriend and they bicker a lot and fight and I just didn't want to be around that so I am living with some of my other friends in the same building but just in a different apartment so I had told my roommate that my dad was the one you didn't want me living with her because like the boyfriend would come over a lot but I mean it was actually I mean obviously my dad like a Gris,0.771
678.1,695.3, but I think but it was mostly me that I just didn't want to live with them if he was going to be visiting all the time so I kind of feel a little guilty that I ditched her but I mean I guess not completely because they fight and bicker so I mean who would want to be around that,0.829
709.2,737.2, I would say deciding to stick with pre-med so far has been the hardest decision just because along the way mean a lot of the classes that I take or super difficult and I put like almost all of my time into studying for them which is obviously kind of annoying at a school like USC because there's so much more that I would want to be doing like going to the beach is like exploring Lala I haven't really had time to do that so A lot of times I think well if I had done it,0.781
737.4,759.9, and major or studied something else I would have had all this free time to do other stuff so deciding just to be pre-med initially and to stick with it this far and to continue doing it has been super challenging because I always think in the back of my head like what my life would have been life and like in college had I majored in something else,0.87
773.9,774.7, hmm,0.817
776.8,799.2, something I regret is my the summer before I started my freshman year I kind of I was originally going to USC and then I got nervous because it was kind of far and I just didn't have all the stuff I needed packed up and like ready to go just like stupid stuff like my bedding and clothes so I got really freaked out and,0.913
800.2,826.8, kind of dropped out of USC and had emailed to school in New York and asked if I could go there instead one that I had gotten into him and so I dropped USC and ended up going to the school in New York and then after like a month it was just so cold and gray and I couldn't see myself there there was just nothing to do so I emailed you Bessie and ended up transferring back but I mean I really regret switching in the first place just because,0.866
827.7,831, it wasn't like a super difficult transition but I just feel like I would have,0.861
832.3,852.4, maybe like my friends better or had a better start at USC had I started first semester freshman year instead of kind of transferring in and I also don't love being referred to as a transfer student or a spring admit because I mean I had gotten and originally for fall so it's kind of annoying but yeah,0.882
867.1,867.8, um,0.704
871,900.5, I think maybe one of the time is that my parents were fighting just like while they were getting divorced like one time it turned into a physical fight they're fighting over some papers and my mom is like trying to call the police my dad like had his arms wrapped around her because he didn't want her to call my mom was screaming like call the police call the police and my brother and I were kind of young my brother is super upset about it and I just wasn't entirely sure what I should do because I like obviously didn't want to call the police on my dad because that's my dad,0.881
900.6,929.1, I didn't want to not call the police in my mom was asking me to needed help so it was kind of an awkward situation with them to put me in my brother was super sad about it so I guess if I could erase something it would be that but I also think that that shaped me as a person for the future so I wouldn't necessarily want to forget it so do you think it made me stronger just like growing up and going forward but I guess that was like the most annoying thing that I've seen in my life so far,0.817
939.9,940.4, no,0.72
952.6,980.5, pretty good I mean I'm always kind of I guess a little bit stressed like underneath just because I volunteering and shadowing and schoolwork and finals are coming up which is not ideal but recently I haven't had any test for like the past week and a half so I've been a little more relaxed but I'm also kind of nervous about taking the MCAT even though it's not until the end of next year it's like a super big test and that thought is always just in the back of my mind,0.808
981,985.6, creating a little Stress and Anxiety but besides that I've been pretty good,0.88
997,997.5, nope,0.789
1004.7,1009.6, I haven't experienced any changes in my thoughts are Behavior lately so yeah,0.746
1022.2,1049.8, it used to be pretty easy now I've kind of had trouble falling asleep not entirely sure why occasionally when I would drink coffee I wouldn't be able to fall asleep but I obviously knew that that was from the caffeine but now I mean I haven't drinking coffee and a while and recently I've been having trouble falling asleep just like before school which is weird it on the weekends I don't have a problem just like on,0.909
1050,1074.8, school days I guess I kind of get nervous because I know how much sleep I should be getting and if I'm not getting that then it kind of freaks me out but also I've been super sensitive to the light and my roommate like goes on her phone with the brightness super loud I mean super bright so that's kind of disturbing when I'm trying to fall asleep but yeah I've just had difficulties falling asleep lately not sure why but yeah,0.91
1086.8,1106.2, if I've missed sleep for a couple of days like if I've only gone like five hours for a few nights in a row then I just kind of don't really function correctly like I'm not irritable or anything or Moody I just make really stupid life mistakes like I would turn like I've turned the sink on,0.894
1109.2,1126.6, and put soap on my hands and then just like want to go walk out of the bathroom or one time I like dried my hands with a paper towel and then threw it in the sink instead of the garbage like I just make stupid life mistakes that I really shouldn't but I guess I'm just super sleep-deprived that I am just not functioning fully,0.819
1142.4,1171.7, I would say it depends on the person and the situation for most people probably for me I don't entirely think so I had like mandatory therapy that I had to go to when my parents were getting divorced just to like talk stuff out and what I experienced is I mean I guess if someone wants to talk about their own problems and come in the Met might be beneficial but mine was kind of for like the relationship between my mom and me,0.856
1172.1,1174, she was annoying because the therapist,0.76
1176.8,1186.6, we tend to agree with my mom a lot of the time even on stuff that like the majority of people would agree that she was wrong with which was like kind of annoying,0.871
1188.7,1201.4, so I guess yeah depends on the situation or if people really like to talk about their problems or try and like realize something about themselves and need help so yeah I would say for the most part it probably is,0.762
1217.6,1218.2, um,0.823
1225.1,1228.7, I probably would have told myself too,0.815
1230.8,1233.7, be less judgmental growing up because I kind of,0.844
1235.6,1240.4, was not the nicest child when I was younger and like throughout middle school and high school,0.887
1243.2,1244.4, my friends were kind of,0.902
1245.6,1248.7, me and I mean not to me but like to other people,0.875
1251.1,1254.6, so I kind of wish I was a little less judgmental because it would have,0.804
1256.1,1277.4, shaped me differently and I going into the health care profession like being judgmental really can't be something that I am at all so I wish that I'd grown up a little differently in that I was less judgmental and more accepting of other people because it would have made just the transition into being a Health Physician a lot easier,0.781
1278.6,1280.4, and like instead I have to work on that now,0.774
1300.2,1305.3, I would say the last time I was really really happy was probably,0.815
1307.7,1337.2, last like not this past summer but the summer before that I used to go to Sleepaway Camp for like eleven Summers and two summers ago was my last summer being there with all of my friends and I just love can't because it's so Carefree so I'm probably happiest there just like I love being at camp and all my friends you're there I was a counselor so just taking care of campers like it's nice because it's a job you get paid for it but it's just like the easiest job,0.782
1339,1349.1, I mean like I would do it for free like I got to do with my friends and just spend my summer pint doing activities in hanging out so probably when I was happiest last,0.871
1350.3,1353.7, like memorable compared to the rest of the time,0.911
1364.4,1392.4, I would say my soccer coach was super was a really good positive influence for me it's actually one of my best friend's moms and she was my coach for travel soccer so when I was in fourth grade you kind of reached out and saw that I was good at soccer and asked if I wanted to join and she was just super encouraging super nice super responsible something that my parents weren't so she would just like,0.897
1392.7,1406.1, me up and take me to soccer games and soccer practices if my mom didn't want to drive me or said it was too far or just like didn't have time because she wanted to do something else so she my soccer coach would kind of step in and just take me,0.908
1408.3,1413.3, and she was just like super encouraging like always tell me like what a good soccer player I was and yeah,0.806
1423.2,1426.2, definitely motivated outgoing,0.816
1427.7,1429, probably judgmental,0.859
1431.3,1438.7, a little aggressive not necessarily just like as a person walking down the street but if someone does something to me or,0.911
1439.9,1442, gets on my bedside so to say,0.857
1444.2,1446.4, then I have a tendency of,0.823
1447.9,1473.4, making sure that they know they're on my bad side or that they did something to offend me so she would definitely describe me that way also probably not like spastic butt like a little I guess I would say weird I used to be a lot weirder when I was younger just like in terms of outgoing in the stuff I would do but you'd probably still describe me as that because I mean she's known me for like 11 years,0.756
1488.4,1517, recently I went to San Diego to visit my cousins I uh I mean I go a lot like I went for Thanksgiving break I used to go a lot more when I was younger but I love going to San Diego just because it's so much more relaxing compared to La everything so clean and bright and there's like no garbage or homeless people anywhere so it's just like a nice break from south-central and it's super relaxing because obviously I like to see my cousins and spend time with them,0.831
1518.8,1525.8, but it's kind of just like a break from La which is nice it's like an actual house and it's like fun to spend time at them,0.871
1539.6,1569.2, I would say just how far I've come on the pre-med track when I started off freshman year I didn't realize how hard it was going to be so I kind of came in with a different expectation ended up doing really poorly in general chemistry had to drop I took a W and then Jin do super well and bio because I was having trouble in the beginning balance and I both come and bio so I wasn't entirely sure that I was going to be able to make it as a pre-med student just because I mean to get,0.855
1569.3,1599.3, to medical school super competitive and you really do need like a 4.0 or very close to it so I wasn't sure that I was going to be able to do that but I just really put in the work and made that my first priority which I didn't think that I was going to be able to just like put everything else aside and like not be worried about hang out with my friends as much or going out as much or doing stuff like that so I was able just to,0.901
1599.3,1608.3, to make like my pre-med class my first priority and then like I've gotten a 4.0 every semester since that which I'm super proud of,0.792
1617.9,1618.5, no problem,0.838
1617.9,1618.5, no problem,0.838
