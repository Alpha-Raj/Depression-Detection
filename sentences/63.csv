26.3,29.3,okay yes,0.828
39.4,40.2, I'm pretty good,0.845
50.3,53.4, I'm from Laguna Hills it's about an hour away from here,0.741
66.2,92.1, I don't know I haven't been here very long this is my first semester at USC so I haven't really been able to explore yet but I since I'm so close I used to I used to come up here every once in a while and so I really like that there's a lot of culture and a lot of like things to do like especially with Hollywood and stuff like that so close kind of thing,0.667
93.5,97.2, that's kind of nice to be able to just do something for a weekend,0.892
104.7,129.6, there's a lot of people in a lot of traffic might where I live where I live not on campus like at home it's very it's a very like home and family kind of area so there's not a lot of people so I'm really used to that and less of a city like area and so I think that would be my biggest thing there's just so many people and it's always busy,0.7
141.3,144.1, like out of the country or just around here,0.875
146.3,147.6, don't know if I can ask questions,0.796
152.5,181.6, oh well out of the country I travel a lot I really like going different places and seeing different things I don't really travel a lot around La or here because again there's just so much traffic in its kind of feels like a little bit of a waste of time to have to sit in such a like traffic e like on the freeway to sit for such a long period of time to do something almost so like I don't know,0.857
181.8,207.5, short so I'd much rather like travel outside the country and fly somewhere and then spend like a lot of time that I designated to do that rather than here and it's nice to just get away especially if you're out of the country like you you're away from everything there's nothing that reminds you of work or anything or like school work or anything that like that and it really helps to like get away from responsibilities every once in a while so I like that,0.838
215.5,244.5, I went to Italy with my parents my sophomore year of high school so about like three years ago that was really fun because we went to Florence and Rome and Venice we went for about like 10 days and that it was really nice to just see a different place because I had never been to La before and it was really fun because I also got to spend time with my family and that was I like spending time,0.853
244.7,271.5, family so that was nice and then it was this because it was my parents are pretty organized so it didn't seem all over the place but also it wasn't with like a tour guide so I was able to we were able to do whatever we wanted whenever we wanted and we were had the option to like not go places if we if we were too tired or something or spend more time in one place I really like that because I didn't feel very rushed but also I felt like I was really able to,0.882
272.2,279.4, get and understand or like have a good experience of Italy that was I really enjoyed that trip,0.783
288.7,316.2, I don't know just traveled like traveling with my parents like in Italy like I said last last question that was really memorable I I mean there's so many great things to see in Italy so that was really that was really fun to explore kind of thing and it's gorgeous so and I have a big appreciation for for arts for the Arts so that was really cool to see all the,0.78
316.7,330, we went to a bunch of museums we got I got to see the statue of David and all things like that and and so that just to see all the art that was super cool and memorable and I really like that,0.868
337.2,365.6, I really like math and science mostly because it's straightforward and you get like for math you get a number and I really like knowing the answer as opposed to the humanities where its interpretive which is interesting because I also like art and so that it kind of contradicts but I really would rather do like math all day then have to read and analyze a book or something and and so math I don't have to see math,0.835
371.7,393.4, now I'm studying to become a doctor or I'm setting for med school so I'm pre-med so I'm taking a bunch of I'm taking math and science classes and so and then I also I'm drawing I like to draw my free time so I do that and then yeah that's pretty much it I pretty much just do school a lot,0.806
405.6,434.6, my dream job is to become a surgeon like a especially a plastic surgeon because it ties in the artistic side and then also the the sciency side of me and then also I really find the human body fascinating and so that so that also also I could use science every day and my artistic side so I've really found that's that's my dream job and so I think that that's a nice happy medium Heat,0.854
434.8,437.7, my two inches by two contrasting interests,0.811
446.3,472, I would definitely consider myself shy it takes me a while to like trust people but once like I once I get to know someone or I decide that I couldn't be comfortable around them it's really easy for me to just talk and to them and really get to know them but at first I'm definitely very shy and I'm very aware of how I present myself which also makes me,0.907
473.1,476.5, even more shy so yeah shy,0.876
484.3,513.6, um I'm the youngest my sister's four years older than I am it's only me and her and then my parents I have a good relationship with my parents I wouldn't say I have the best relationship with my parents because they parent did me a little too much and so especially like my later years of high school like my Junior and Senior year I felt like they were kind of hovering and but I feel like now that I'm living on my own and I've been living on my own for,0.816
514.6,543.9, couple months now it really gives me a little bit of appreciation for them because I realize how much they actually do like I'm in an apartment so I have to clean my apartment I have to make my own food and I have to get on my own schedule kind of thing and so it really I really have a lot of a lot more respect for them now than I did when I was living at home but and so I think live not living at home has definitely made my relationship with my parents stronger because I don't see them every day,0.787
544,573.9, yeah and that helps me I get really annoyed really easily so that helps me not be annoyed by them which is good for relationships but I would say like my family like I have a good relationship with my family and I always try to look at it on the bright side like it could be like I don't have the worst situation I have a pretty good situation like my parents have been married for they just celebrated their 33rd anniversary and so they're still together which is so rare these days and then I have a,0.703
574.2,581.8, who have a good relationship with and I know that I have any said sort of problem I can always go back to them and rely on them so that's really nice,0.865
589.3,617.6, I want I watch a lot of Netflix or I draw I tried to find shows that I can just completely focus on and forget about everything else around me just so I don't hyper focus on anything negative or anything like that but that tends to be negative bad because I get carried away or something like that but I really enjoy and then drawing I'm taking a drawing class so that's really nice that I can,0.913
617.9,627.8, that and then and then have that as like a break or like a relaxing time but still be but still pretty be productive with my art class so I try to do that too,0.876
636.8,665.2, I'm pretty good it takes a I feel like it takes a lot for me to get angry but once I'm angry a lot of things will bother me I'm I mean I'm pretty calm most the time but then once like what like I said once something bothers me that a lot of other things start to bother me mostly because my patients is more like worn down or something like that but I'd say,0.877
665.7,667.6, I'm pretty good at controlling my temper,0.909
681.1,710.7, um I don't know like really argued or really argued it's been awhile but like had a disagreement it was probably somewhat recently because I asked my mom to do something that my sister did when she was my age and my mom was kind of iffy about it and so I you know I kind of said but you let my sister do it when she was my age kind of thing it and that was about like having my,0.756
710.9,733.4, friend over when we're going on a trip for spring break for a couple days and so that was about like having him come over because my sister did that when she was a freshman in college as well and so that was like the most recent disagreement the most recent argument I can't remember it's probably been a while since I've had like a big argument,0.845
747.6,775.6, there are a lot of situations when I was living at home that I probably should have handled differently like I I know that my parents have my best interest in mind I see that a lot more now than I did when I was at home again because once you like step back from situation you don't spend a lot of time with the person that you really like appreciate them and so I feel like I should have been a little bit more appreciative and a little bit calmer,0.898
776,805.7, and more more relaxed with my parents especially because I like now I know that they really do have my best interest in mind and they were just looking out for me but at the time I didn't see that and so I feel like I would lash out a lot more not lash out but I would just become more irritated by them quicker and I think I should have been a little bit more patient and little calmer also because sometime in Spring and mint I was with them extra semester earlier than,0.898
805.9,834.4, than typically and so and so I think that I had the idea that I'm a college student but I was still living at home so they kind of treated me I felt like they kind of treated me like I was still high school even though I was actually I was like doing community college so I felt like I was actually a college student now I realized completely different but at the time I didn't I didn't see it at all so I felt like it was they were being unnecessarily,0.856
836.5,837.6, overparenting,0.835
848.6,877.6, I really feel guilty again like with my parents that I didn't really but I wasn't really appreciative or like that I didn't really have a high like patients kind of thing I mean again like I know I now that I should have been a little bit more patient with them and a little bit more relaxed just because I now that I know that they really did have my best interest in mind I kind of feel like I should have,0.783
878,905.2, appreciate it a lot more and now I see that they've done that they did a lot for me like they clean the house regularly and my house is pretty clean and now I see that because my my Apartments really dirty and I tried to like get other people to clean or keep it clean but it's not as easy as just being like hey can you clean and so I I really am now I'm really appreciative and I really wish I had been appreciative of that when I was looking at home so yeah,0.856
915.9,945.8, like I said I'm a spring admit and so that was pretty hard because I was worried that I was going to miss out on a lot especially since I'm shy and I feel like in a lot of social situations that you know coming in second semester or even even if you come in like a year later everyone's already found their friend group and know and I've sometimes I feel like you know no one wants no one wants to like add a new person and so that was really,0.899
945.9,975.7, hard for me to decide because USC was my dream school and so it was kind of hard for me to decide is it really worth it to be set back and then I was afraid because I'm pretty mad and so I was afraid that well that one semester set me back in my studies and and things like that so that was a huge decision for me whether to come to USC or to go somewhere else that I had that I had all for all four years all full four years kind of thing that was that,0.835
975.9,977.2, was a really hard decision for me,0.787
989.3,1017.2, I don't regret a lot I kind of I tried to not regret anything I tried to think about my actions in a way that I would be proud of it later I was really I'm really fortunate to have been raised to think that way and raised to think what way will what actions will it be proud of in the future so that so I don't so I don't regret any mistakes that I've made but,0.864
1017.5,1047.3, some I when I was in high school I was really sneaky with my parents mostly because I felt like they didn't that I felt like they over parented and I feel like that was very wrong of me and I kind of regret you know not trusting them because now I like I look back and I'm like they really did have my best interest in mind and so I kind of regret not trusting them when they've had so many more years of experience than I have and I thought you know like,0.908
1047.4,1054.2, all teenagers like a lot of teenagers think you know I thought I knew I knew but what's best for me but I now I know I really didn't so,0.806
1067.4,1093.7, I really wished when I especially like in high school I really wish that I didn't live at home and that was also again like I didn't really have a great relationship with my parents when I was at home living at home and I really wish that I had been more tolerant because there are a couple days where I was just so frustrated and angry at my parents that I was like I just don't want to live at home anymore and now looking back at that like that was,0.908
1094.5,1115.8, that's really awful thing to think about especially because I am so fortunate to have such amazing parents who do care about me and like I said I could have it a lot worse and I really wished that I you know had not thought about it like that I really wish I had looked on the bright side as opposed to negative things,0.827
1125.3,1125.7, no,0.755
1136.2,1165.4, um I'm pretty good it's kind of stressful because I feel like I just had midterms and then now I have a second round of midterms this week and so that's kind of stressful because I feel like I just I just did that but but it's so that I'm pretty sure just about that but also I feel like I can fly just keep pushing through it's almost spring break so I can I can make it but,0.855
1165.9,1168, yeah so I'm I'm pretty stressed,0.722
1176.9,1203.9, um recently I've been happier I think that's because I know that there's a break coming up and I know if I just keep like pushing through I'm gonna be fine and then also I'm looking and I see that that you know the school years almost done like it's the final push like all I have to do is just keep up with my work and so that's that's been really helping me,0.877
1212.2,1240.5, it depends sometimes I take some medication that that has a side effect of insomnia but but if I take all my medication then I'm fine like because I have ADHD so some my meds give me insomnia but other ones fix that but if I take it too late in the day then I don't want to take the ones that fix that so last night I had a bad night's sleep but,0.883
1240.8,1246.3, typically I'm pretty good at going asleep and staying asleep waking up as the hard part for me,0.874
1253.3,1274.8, I'm really grumpy and irritated like I said like I'm pretty I'm a pretty patient person but once something bothers me and once my patience has worn thin then I'm not so my patience level is a lot like I have a lot less patience when I'm tired or sleep deprived so there's a little I'm grumpy,0.909
1286.2,1315.2, yeah I I I was in therapy my senior year from April of 2018 to December 2018 and then I came here and and I noticed a huge difference once I stopped doing therapy so I've started to go back to therapy again and I already noticed I've only had a couple sessions of their of with this new therapist but I already have noticed is huge difference in my life and it's super helpful,0.797
1329,1358.2, well I'm only 18 so 10 years ago I would have been eight then I would have been like get a lot more sleep it's not that big some of those things that I'm worrying about aren't that big of a deal like and also I like keep up a good working schedule and and try not to get behind because once you get behind it's like a it's like a a big snowball like it just keeps building up nothing ever gets easier everything always,0.846
1358.4,1364.4, harder and so I would really advise myself to like make sure I stay on top of a lot of things,0.885
1376.2,1406.1, I was really happy this weekend my boyfriend came up for the weekend to visit me so that was that was really nice whenever I'm not stressed basically so a lot of times in the weekends because the weekends I purposely like I purposely do nothing so I purposely don't do a lot of homework which in reality I probably should just so I make my weeks easier but also it's good to just sit and,0.902
1406.2,1413.8, relax and not have to worry about anything so a lot of times in the weekends and with that when I'm with my boyfriend because he makes me happy,0.851
1426,1454.5, my parents have always been a positive influence and my sister because she's very outgoing and she she's sees the world in such a happy View and so she really encouraged like looking at her and watching her really encourages me to think about the the better things in life and not focus on such negative things and then also my boyfriend is super supportive of me and he really encourages me to really get like the full college experience,0.798
1454.6,1484.4, parents so who encouraged me to like go to group meet our go to Club meetings and go out and he did I feel like that's really good because I know a lot of people are in situations where their significant other is really wants them to stay in and spend time with them and talk to them my boyfriend really encourages me to really get outside and and do some and have some fun and not rely on him for everything because he knows that I'm going he doesn't want me to look back and regret not doing it stuff,0.844
1493.5,1521.7, my best friend would describe me as probably a generally happy person but obviously everyone has their bad time since but she would also probably describe me as organ or somewhat organized like all of my I know where everything is and like it my room may be a mess but I know everything is and also I'm very she probably say I'm very determined like anything I put my mind to all,0.797
1522,1543, I'll do it and and like I have the mental capacity to really do anything I want to I think the problem is I don't want to do some things and so I think she sees that you know if she gives me a little push then I'll be able to do whatever I want but I think she would really say I'm determined mainly,0.79
1552.5,1579.8, like I said earlier I spent the weekend with my boyfriend so that was that was really nice because he doesn't go to USC he actually he actually lives were I was like he lives in Laguna Hills where I'm from or he lives in Irvine which is very close to the gonna house so it's really nice because I don't get to see him every day it's so it was really nice to spend time and I like yesterday we did nothing we we watched TV,0.852
1580,1580.7, and everything,0.809
1582.9,1584.2, there is a knock at the door,0.775
1589.5,1596.9, where I am right now because I'm I'm a student studying for med school so that's that's pretty amazing,0.778
1599.2,1600.2, I don't know what to do,0.829
1605.9,1606.4, okay,0.797
1609.2,1610.9, oh nope there's someone at the door,0.86
