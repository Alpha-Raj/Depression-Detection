386.3,386.7, yeah,0.804
395.4,396.5, I wasn't speaking,0.823
399.5,405, I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm pretty mild mannered I really don't get mad at anyone to be honest,0.899
415.3,437.9, I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm very like mellow I rarely get mad at anyone I don't really lash out against anyone even if I am angry I really don't like take it out on others I can usually control my anger really well and I can if I have an issue I'll talk to someone I rarely get like fuming mad you know what I mean yeah I'm pretty good,0.887
444.4,445.6, yes it is,0.913
454,455.4, I didn't say anything,0.837
465.9,476.4, oh well my roommate Justin and I sometimes argue about like who she take out the trash or like who should wash the dishes,0.803
479.4,497.5, yeah and then sometimes I argue with my parents because they sometimes nag me when I drive which you know I guess every parent does that to be honest I don't get into that many arguments with people and most of the arguments I get into like pretty like,0.891
498.8,502.1, simple like nothing major yeah,0.9
514.4,515.4, um,0.896
519.4,523.1, good question let me think,0.852
540.6,562.5, so once about two weeks ago I was walking along the streets and these two Mormons like wanted to talk to me but I didn't really want to talk to them so I made up an excuse saying I had to leave and just watch,0.913
562.6,571.2, way so I felt kind of bad about that just like at the time I didn't really want to speak to them because I knew they'd like to try to convert me to Mormonism,0.761
573.9,585.2, yeah I just felt kind of bad about like leaving them like I maybe I could have gave them more time because I wasn't that much in a rush but like I just didn't really want to talk to them like,0.844
586.4,590.8, I guess it happens like I feel bad about it but like you know,0.868
596.5,597.9, I hope I don't offend anyone,0.81
602.9,603.4, yeah,0.789
606.6,636.3, oh yeah that's a simple one back in 2017 when I had to decide which college to come to that was a really hard decision because I was between USC UCLA or Boston College and maybe Georgia Tech yeah so those four colleges and I knew like wherever I go that be a major decision because I'll be spending probably the next four years of my life at that college so like,0.903
637.2,666.8, I like USC and UCLA but like I was kind of conflicted about coming so far from home because I'm an only child so I feel like my parents would miss me and like it'd be really hard for them to come visit me but if I went to so if I went to Boston College I could leave me that issue but I didn't really like Boston College so it's kind of good to Lemon for me and ultimately I just decided on USC because I felt more comfortable here but it was definitely hard,0.732
667,674.2, for me like the week before May first I was like really stressed because like I was making such a major life decision,0.803
676.1,677.4, but I feel like I made the right choice,0.847
682.2,682.8, yes,0.913
689.4,691.3, what's something I regret,0.728
693.6,722.1, so I'm interested in becoming a doctor and I regret not applying to more of those joint like bachelor's and MD programs is there a lot of them but during High School I didn't really focus on those so I wish I could have focused more on applying to more of those programs because I could have saved myself a lot of like time and effort because I could get direct admission to one of those schools and,0.902
722.8,741.8, because I guess in high school I was in that sure about becoming a doctor so I didn't really want to light limit myself but looking back I wish I did more because I knew I wanted to become a doctor like in high school I was like maybe like 80% sure but now I really want to so I kind of wish I went to like one of those programs so I regret not applying to more,0.816
744,766.5, yeah well you know life is what it is hindsight's 20/20 so yeah you got to just come to terms with your decision and like I think I can get into Medical School anyways but like I just regret not like being more aggressive during high school and like just trying for more programs a little cliche,0.899
782.3,783.7, yes give me a second,0.838
788.1,817, oh so in high school I volunteered with the EMS and I witnessed someone overdose on heroin which like it was kind of cool to see like the treatment that like the police and First Responders gave to but like it's kind of a little bit traumatic I didn't have like any like post-traumatic stress disorder but like it was kind of stressful to see like someone's suffering like almost,0.828
817.2,834.3, dying so I guess like since I'm going to become a doctor I have to get used to that and in high school I also did an internship with the local hospital and one day I was on the oncology Ward and,0.816
835.6,865.2, the pre these two patients I had met had passed the next day so that was kind of sad for me because I talk to them like the previous day and the next day when I came back they had already succumbed to cancer which is kind of sad yeah but I hate you have to come to you have to be able to like handle that if you want to become a doctor I feel because medicines all the like helping people through like tough times and like sometimes people are like terminally ill so there's nothing you can do and,0.8
865.4,873.8, make the best thing you can do is like provide them comfort and like do the best you can just I don't know it was a good experience for me like,0.799
875.1,880.5, yeah it showed me like how it like kind of bolstered my like interest for medicine,0.827
882.1,894.5, yeah so I guess I really want I wouldn't want to erase it but like at the same time I do because like it's kind of weird but like you know he just gotta be strong,0.903
900.7,901.5, I have not,0.801
907.7,913.8, yeah I haven't served and I do not want to serve either I feel like it is not for me,0.911
920.1,945.3, um I've been all right I've been a little stressed I have had many exams like one week after the other like projects so it's definitely stressful for me and like I have a MCAT coming up over the summer and there there's some Concepts I had to review yeah so it's the stress what time for me but I think college is stressful for everyone especially for like me because I want to apply to medical school,0.763
946.7,947.1, yeah,0.72
952.3,955.3, it's alright everyone has to deal with stress,0.782
958.5,976.4, and I feel like how you deal with it kind of like the fines you because like you shouldn't let your stress to find who you are like you have to be you have to overcome the stress because like there's always greener pastures once you overcome it in my opinion so you fight on as the USC motto is,0.744
988.8,1002.6, not particularly sometimes I do worry about my future more than I did in like high school but I think that's normal because I'm coming to that age like I'm already I'm 19 and a half so,0.898
1004,1020.2, and like a few years I have to like I'll be all adult in the system like Society so I have to like worry about all the like things adults have to worry about like housing like food where do I live like how much taxes do I have to pay like yeah,0.857
1030.5,1048, it's pretty good I mean I had like eight hours a day I mean that's sufficient but like I wish I could more fun like I don't really need that much sleep according to research I also think,0.898
1049.9,1079.6, yeah eight hours is pretty normal for me sometimes I sleep a little less sometimes I sleep a little more it depends on average eight hours you have when I am not at school like when I'm on break I tend to sleep a little more like usually I averaged like nine hours but I think that's because I don't have that much on my mind during break because like all I have to worry about is like having fun are like relaxing but like during school like I have to constantly think about my assignments what,0.695
1080,1094.3, I have like I think I'm a little stressed during school so that kind of contributes like my lower levels of sleep but like it's not like I'm sleep-deprived I had like at least seven and a half which I think is pretty good,0.75
1095.2,1095.6, yeah,0.801
1101.1,1109.6, um I'm definitely more tired when I don't sleep well I may be a little cranky but I think that's normal,0.893
1112.6,1114.4, definitely just a little more tired,0.862
1116.4,1146, especially around the late afternoon light sometimes like my neck gets a little sore if I don't sleep well yeah and then finite time I just feel really tired and then I'll just sleep a little more you know it is normal I think yeah I'm not that much different to be honest I haven't been sleeping if I had before that much there's like over spring break I tended to stay up late and I still wake up early so like I kind of felt,0.719
1146.2,1150.8, tired but you know I don't feel bad I'm just little just tired,0.868
1156.7,1157.1, yeah,0.812
1163.7,1179.2, um I guess it's kind of nice to talk to someone about your feelings but I don't feel like I need therapy to be honest but yeah it's like it's nice talking to someone about like your feelings and stuff,0.88
1180.4,1189.8, I can understand how it would help someone if you're if you're in a crisis or like you need like Help Therapy definitely helps in my opinion,0.843
1205.4,1224.3, well I wasn't born 20 years ago so if I were 10 years ago I'd be like nine and I probably be in fourth grade I probably tell myself so in elementary school I wasn't like the smartest kids I wasn't like,0.809
1227.1,1241.6, like dumb either and I kind of like was a little like upset that some of my friends were doing better than me so I tell myself like be like be patient because like eventually you'll,0.907
1242.9,1267.9, grow more you mature more and like you'll figure it out there's always opportunities for you and that worked out for me because like once I hit Middle School I was doing really well in school and yeah I got into some pretty good colleges yeah just be patient do the best you can because like even if you,0.703
1269.9,1296.7, don't like accomplish all your goals no one can accomplish all of your goals like as Conan O'Brien said once like nothing in life goes perfect so like just go with what life gives you because life always provides opportunities for you and like your parents were always supports you there always be there for you in my opinion so yeah don't be like too stressed,0.894
1297.9,1301.9, yeah yeah life always provides for you I think,0.89
1309.3,1309.9, yes,0.757
1319.4,1338.4, actually this week so I took a physics exam on Tuesday and I got a 100 on it so I was really happy about that and then like three weeks ago I had my first visit exam and I got a 98 so I was pretty happy about that um,0.859
1341.8,1356, yeah those are the most recent yeah those are the most recent events like thinking back to like when I was really happy was like what I'd say maybe,0.903
1358.3,1387.6, like right when I got into college I was really happy like because like a burden came off my shoulders because like why do you like would get into college right but like getting that first and missions is like makes you really happy and like you know that like as my friend once said to me I won't be a trashman yeah but like yeah so I recently yeah my really good scores on the physics tests made me pretty happy but like the happiest I've been since I,0.857
1388.2,1398.4, it is like when I got into college like my first admissions to like Rutgers and I got a full ride to it so I was pretty happy about that yeah but that's enough topic,0.74
1405.8,1413.3, definitely my parents so like my mom and dad have been a really good influence on me I think they definitely taught me well,0.901
1416.9,1438.1, yeah I think my parents have definitely been a positive influence on me they've talking like good work ethic I treat people with respect like treat people well yeah it's worked out for me when I feel like my teachers really like me and like the work ethic they my parents helped develop for me like has put me where I am,0.857
1439.8,1447.4, and there's definitely room for improvement on my part because I think if they give me advice but sometimes I don't really listen but looking back I should,0.816
1453.8,1455.1, my best friend,0.822
1459.2,1475.6, I think he definitely say I'm a pretty smart guy cuz especially in like the math and sciences I know she probably describe me also is like pretty caring because I always try to help him out with like his homework like if he has issues I'm always there to like talk with him about it,0.812
1479.8,1498, yeah definitely like smart and caring compassionate pretty nice everyone says I'm a pretty nice guy they always remark that I always have a smile on my face which I'm pretty proud about just like I want to give people an impression that I like,0.88
1499.3,1501.6, I'm a positive person like I pride myself in that,0.801
1513.2,1514, recently,0.913
1516.4,1538, okay so I have the game Grand Theft Auto 5 and I've been so I got the game about a year and a half ago and I play on and off but over spring break I actually beat the entire campaign and then I got a bit sum of money so that was pretty enjoyable I also went on a few bike rides over spring break,0.845
