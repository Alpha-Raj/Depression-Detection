69.7,82.5, I think we have a lot of diversity of culture and I think the weather here is better than most places actually and aside from that traffic is not that great,0.868
90,106.9, yeah so I guess the traffic is pretty bad so it kind of shakes where I can drive I guess other than that like I guess the smog but it hasn't been that much of an issue recently it's expensive to live here that's also an issue,0.865

139.5,157.6, I just exploring new places so I guess I like going on adventures so traveling is a way to Adventure and it just nice to be away from LA because since I've lived here all my life I kind of like sometimes I get bored of it so it's nice to go to some other place to experience new things,0.833

194.2,221.4," I guess in general one my not pertaining traveling one of my most memorable experiences would be performing for a drum and bugle Corps during the summer I was in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indiana where the jnana neapolis Cults play and I performed with a jump unicorn front of an audience of around 20,000 people and like I guess that performance was perhaps one of the most my most",0.872
221.7,224.3, emotional and most memorable experience this,0.843
233.5,257.9, in school my favorite subject was actually history I guess when I grew up I watch I was on the History Channel and as a result I had a kind of affinity for history like I'd had games that be kind of historical so I guess Translating that experience school made history a lot more enjoyable for me and I guess a lot easier too,0.728
264.8,270.5, all right now I'm currently a cognitive science major with a computer programming minor at USC,0.825
282.8,307.9, guess my dream job would be probably like a musician so I was a musician most of my life and you know I guess being musician would basically be saying that like you're doing what you love as a profession but you know in reality it's very difficult you know the being musician doesn't guarantee you a job and,0.829
308.1,315.8, you know wouldn't it's difficult to sustain a lifestyle tubing position and I don't think I'm talented enough either,0.841
325.4,339.8, it depends on the circumstance I can be shy but I don't think it's more shy I think it's more like I don't care to socialize but I guess in a sense I can be pretty outgoing to as well depends on the circumstance,0.906
346.2,361.8, I like to adapt to my surroundings so I guess in a way I consider myself a intro extrovert so obviously I mean third have different moods and those different moves correlate with whether or not I want to be outgoing or whether or not I want to be more reserved,0.862
363.2,367.4, but in no sense do I consider myself shy I don't think so,0.89
374.9,403.9, my family I think I have a pretty solid relationship with my family I don't think it's a typical one I think it's more like a more traditional Chinese one I guess I'm the only child so because of that I carry a lot of responsibility with my parents for my parents and and as a result I guess I feel more stressed by the same time being the only child allows you to get a lot of tension and you know their focus is solely,0.857
404,412.2, on you so there's that other than that my relationship with my family's pretty good yeah,0.759
420.4,443, to relax so on days when I do get time to relax I generally like no I'll either go out to the in a way go out and just kind of relax at a park or something or maybe just chill for a few friends I could also you know just listen to music that would be pretty relaxing to me too or maybe nap snappings that's pretty good,0.851
451.7,467.4, I'm really good at controlling my temper I'm very I stay very cool headed I believe I'm I don't really get mad at people at all or things very rarely like even with LA traffic I don't like get mad I might get irritated but I won't get mad,0.835
477.5,502.4, I'm trying to think I mean it was probably like with my girlfriend but it wasn't a big argument I guess it was a small argument and there's no yelling it was more of a talk but we were just debating points and a sense I was arguing and I guess it was about just communication issues so aside from that like we resolved it because you know we didn't lose our temper we were yelling at each other,0.742
521.6,545.9, I think a situation that I would handle differently would be like my process of transitioning between high school and college I think for me being a string it really it was a different experience for me and I said I was kind of caught off guard I came in not knowing what to expect as I'd already spent a semester in a community college which isn't even close to the same experience at being at USC,0.896
546.7,558.2, so I wish I could have had under transition a lot better perhaps like because of that if I had had the transition that a lot better perhaps I'd be in a better position that I am today and yeah,0.811
571.4,599.7, one thing I feel guilty about I feel guilty for I guess right as of right now I feel more guilty about not spending as much time with my family I've been pretty busy with school and work so I've been kind of stuck at school even though I live only around like 30 minutes away I prefer to stay at school because going home it can only get work done over there and I have to deal with like a guest of deal with another set of different issues there,0.743
621.8,622.9, let me think,0.803
627.7,632.8, I find it hard to kind of find a the hardest decision as,0.837
634.5,652.2, I'm not usually confronted with decisions that are super difficult I I might be confronted with a lot of like decisions were that are kind of small but in the end add up to Big Picture however really like difficult decisions I don't usually make I guess one of them could have been,0.909
653.9,664.4, deciding on which college to go to it was pretty difficult but Indiana like I chose USC for kind of obvious reasons I guess in a sense it wasn't that difficult,0.798
672.1,698, I regret I guess I regret not being more decided on my career path early on because I switched Majors around two times and for me I guess even though allowed me to explore a lot of different perspectives on I feel like I could have said that time a lot better had I had prepared I guess in high school on what I want really actually wanted to do,0.732
698.5,701.5, Paradiso like what perhaps my dad wanted to do,0.757
717.9,741.3, I don't think there's a memory I'd want to erase ampere per se because I think memories are important for shaping the person like the person who I am today and even though there might be events where I would prefer to not like have in my memory I think it's so important and I still learn from it regardless,0.804
748.7,752,I have not,0.803
762.4,788.2, I'm feeling a lot more stressed I guess because just because of school they increase School workload I'm right now I'm a little sick so I guess I don't feel as well and my mind slow cloudy as a result also have a project that's due tomorrow so there's that ongoing stress going on however I'm kind of looking forward for the school year to end as well but I'm also low stressed about what I'm going to be doing during summer,0.876
800.2,821.4, I think my behavior and thoughts have been pretty consistent I will say because of the additional stress I guess I've been more I guess more tired as a result I've been getting less sleep so because I've been dealing with less sleep I've been less inclined to perhaps go out and said I'd rather like focus on my studies,0.881
826.9,844.2, if I haven't consumed any caffeine so it's not an issue for me to fall asleep I think however if I do have caffeine you know as usual it might be a little difficult for me to sleep,0.909
851.7,862.6, if I don't sleep well usually I wake up really groggy and I guess for the rest of that day I usually feel a lot more tired than usual and because I feel more tired I feel less motivated,0.874
874.8,895.1, I think therapy is very useful I think especially for a lot of people who do you know go through a lot of issues I think it's important to talk about it talking to me as one it's like the first step in healing I believe so therapy is pretty useful because if you keep all these emotions within yourself they're only going to get worse and they're only going to build up from there,0.913
909.6,916.5, yes 10 and 20 years ago one advice I would have given myself is probably too,0.794
918.5,938.2, search for my personal happiness or I want to say I had a pretty good childhood given a circumstances and I was pretty fortunate enough so the sensor probably appreciate what you had more and probably use that appreciation as a motivation for the future self,0.779
950.6,976.2, the last time I felt really happy was probably when I was spending a day with my girlfriend and it was it was the day we were going and I guess with her I'm pretty happy around her so we were going on a date and I guess at that moment I felt pretty happy because I at that time I was really stressed with school as much as I was able to enjoy the time for and I was pretty happy,0.863
981.8,982.7, that's great,0.905
985.7,1006, impossible so some I've had a lot of positive influences in my life like a lot of friends but the one that sticks out to me is my girlfriend she's kind of been my emotional support she's someone I can talk to she's my best friend and because of that like she's been a great presence in my life,0.792
1016.4,1038.3, so I guess my best friend would probably describe me as kind of quirky a little funny a little silly however so my bathroom who was also my girlfriend would probably also describe me as a pretty complex person and she kind of knows my nuances and I was all she kind of like sees me in the bigger picture rather than the smaller picture,0.877
1055,1083.8, so recently I want to one of my friends house who lived pretty close to me it was a it's a Thursday night but and I had class the next day but my friends invited me so hot pot party like kind of a potluck kind of thing really spontaneously and so I went there and it was a good time to spend it was a good time to spend like just like I guess catching off a few friends and like well we're all we got pretty full and overall we're pretty content to us,0.795
1093.3,1119.4, I'm most proud of I guess personally I'm most proud of I guess the ethics and morals that I have I believe in a sense although I'm not completely content with my life I believe I'm content with the way I want to approach my life and how and like kind of like the wisdom that I can share with other people so I'm pretty content with that as a person,0.911
