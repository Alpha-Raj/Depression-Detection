26.1,26.5,yeah,0.763
38,44.1, I'm doing good today not much has gone on so I mean good feel productive,0.881
50.5,55.2, I'm from Moorpark California which is about 50 miles west of here,0.805
64.4,82.8, um I mean aside from USC and how I mean I just kind of busy town there's a lot to do you're not far from the beach I'm not far from home I'm not too far from anything really so I mean I like everything that kind of goes on around here,0.908
94.1,112.8, everything is everybody's in such a rush to get everywhere I mean there's a lot to do which is fun and everything but that's just too crowded and people kind of worrying about taking care of getting where they need to go and take care of what they need to do and it's just kind of gets overwhelming at times and,0.796
114.9,121.3, no I like as much as the city's I kind of fun I still like outdoorsy type areas and whatnot and,0.773
122.8,124.9, I don't know it's just not exactly that,0.801
135.4,161.3, when I was younger like before I started water polo with my dad I did do a lot of road trips with him in my sisters and my mom was there for the most part but yeah I love road trips and I like traveling to you know countryside's and lakes and mammoths and all kinds of places with my family so yeah I do I used to travel a lot now I travel for water polo to like different countries so yeah,0.817
167.9,197.4, um you know for road trips I kind of like long drives I like long drives and staring out the window and then you start thinking about different things in life and as far as like wherever mean my family would go it was a nice family bonding and it makes me think about the future when I travel with my kids and how it kind of brings people together so I really like that aspect of traveling how like brings you and whoever you're traveling with together or if you were on or if I'm on my own just kind of driving it's nice to have this,0.902
198,216.9, to kind of think about whatever but it's your away from everything so it's kind of like an escape so that's what I like about traveling as well as like the fun things you do when you get there but I think I like the more the family bonding aspect of when I travel and as far as like traveling with my team it's like bonding in that aspect so,0.827
225.4,253.8, well this summer I traveled to Hungry with the senior National the USA senior national team for water polo we traveled the hungry and we were there for like about it was a month we were there for a month we trained in three different locations one was eggar I can't remember the first city we were in and then we ended up in Budapest for world's super fun there was like Budapest was beautiful just general hungry was a really nice place not much in,0.89
254,283.8, - to be spoken which was kind of difficult but I mean we were with all of our teammates and had like translators and whatnot for us and then there was by time we got to Budapest there's a lot of people that were running the thing and so there's just a lot of people from all over the place that were there and so that was that was pretty fun I was a great team bonding thing especially because it's my first time traveling with that team and then yeah Budapest was beautiful nice city we didn't get to see,0.865
283.9,312.8, see too much of it because we were competing but it's really exciting world's I've never seen a stadium so packed OC water polo because it's really big out there so yeah it was a long trip though and I'm not one to travel I don't really like traveling by planes I'd rather drive and so is long flights and on top of that we were gone for a really long time away from my family and boyfriend and whatever but on the whole it was so great to be with that team and really exciting to be a part of it,0.844
326,328.5, I think my most memorable experience,0.831
331.2,353.4, I think from that trip would be kind of just when we were like cruising down so we were on our competition site in our practice I was on Margaret Island where they like there was the venue where we would compete and sometimes practice and so I think the most memorable thing was like being new to that team I ended up being like the designated,0.908
355.9,384.9, designated well I was a person that was designated bring those speaker and play music so it was kind of cool that they'd have me do that and they liked all my music and I play like oldies and Country and everything and so we would be on the boat traveling back and forth from our hotel down the Little River to the Danube to Margaret Island and I'd played music and I think that was really memorable for me to just kind of sit there and take everything in it was just like a little water taxi and everyone like listening to that kind of music and everybody was so nice and so I think just,0.808
386.4,405.7, that part of it that aspect of kind of traveling together down the river to practice and being called on to like play music and everyone sing along to it was pretty memorable for me because I really like music so I thought it was pretty cool for them to I guess get to know me in that way,0.858
416.3,442.4, I guess my favorite subject in school when I was in high school was probably is probably I probably the easiest time well actually like we probably the easiest time was English and it was the most interesting I like giving speeches and stuff and writing wasn't too bad I was too into science or math and then I really like history too,0.891
443.8,451, so English and history were probably my two favorites but now like being here USC my favorite subject is is definitely psycho psychology,0.911
457.8,472.1, okay so now I do psychology and I'm really interested in sports psychology and hope to do Sports psych after I'm done playing water polo but I do like psychology and I like talking about like the idea of being a therapist or sports psychologist one day,0.779
487.3,496.4, well I play a lot of water polo right now while I'm studying to do psychology but if I would didn't do psychology and I didn't play water polo,0.83
499,523.7, I'd love to do something around like being a sportscaster or doing something around music because I love I like speaking and also motivational speaking so probably sportscasting or motivational speaking would be big for me or something around music I mean I don't think I have the voice to be a singer but that'd be pretty cool if I could think was I do really enjoy singing,0.808
534.1,562.3, I consider myself pretty outgoing pretty loud I'm pretty pretty open certain situations I might start out shy for a few minutes till I kind of gauge the people I'm around but for the most part I think I filter myself pretty well so I don't really have any shame in anything I anything like I think about what I say before I say it so I'm pretty open to saying things and I think it breaks down awkwardness with people if there's one person at least if I was embarrassing at least,0.807
563.3,570.6, would bond together in noting that about me so I'm really not embarrassed easy so I'm not I'm not really shy,0.807
577.8,605.6, well I don't know growing up my dad's pretty open guy he's pretty straightforward he's pretty I don't know how to describe it I just have a really close relationship with my dad and my whole family is like pretty open with each other and I've just found that like through high school and whatever I really loved public speaking and people supported me with it and then playing sports I think helped with that just kind of you put yourself in this on this stage like with sports where people are watching you and I think that kind of opened me up more to it when I was in high school,0.805
607.2,631.7, and then from there as far as speaking I don't know I've always been comfortable with public speaking just because what you make a mistake you make a mistake but I don't find I feel like that happens to everybody so it's just not a big deal if it really happens and then if you go out and you're just kind of confident what you say and if you're just if you just think about things like you're just having a conversation with people then what's there to be so scared of,0.848
633.7,649.6, I don't really worry about impressing people too much yeah yeah I mean you want everybody to like you and in certain ways but I don't worry about being the perfect fit for a certain crowd I just kind of try and fit myself into whatever crowd just,0.881
650.7,655.4, break certain clicks and and whatnot and I hope that people take to it,0.788
665.7,669.8, well I'm really close with my dad my dad and I have been like best friends for,0.913
671,682.3, ever definitely Daddy's girl and my mom and I are pretty close I think my mom and I are closer than my mom is to my other two sisters so I'm really close to both my parents but even more so my dad,0.86
684.4,713.8, and I'm closest with my sisters and closes every one of them but my little sister I'm probably closer to we spent more time together so you should have gone on the older sister had different interests but even at that mean the little sister got along a lot better than me to the older sister heard of the older sister but ever since she's been back from college we've been all like really close but my little sister's pretty open to me about all of her boy troubles friend troubles,0.743
714.1,741.8, School modeling all of the above so she and I have like an open line of communication that me and my older sister we didn't talk about that stuff so much when we were growing up so I think being able stood along better and my dad and I are pretty I'm pretty open with my dad I don't really have much I keep from my dad if anything and so I think I'm closest to my mom and my dad and my little sister but still close to my mom and my older sister,0.91
749.7,758.2, you know I don't I wouldn't consider myself a relaxed person often I just have a lot going on all the time but my idea of relaxing is,0.862
760.6,774.3, probably I like coming home I like taking a hot shower or bath and then I like putting on my PJs sitting watching TV and just not doing much because I'm usually on the go all the time have practice driving,0.901
776.3,799.5, with friends with teammates with family just having stuff to get done all the time that for me to just shower sit watch TV is probably or even not watch TV but just sit and listen to music is probably the most relaxing thing for me or to lay on the beach or lay outside and just kind of like soak in the Sun and just lay there's probably the most relaxing thing for me,0.883
809.5,815.3, I think I control my temper fairly well but I do get agitated when I don't for example,0.816
816.7,845.8, practice say the same mistake happens over and over again I tend to like clenched my fists and you can tell I'm a little pissed off but overall I think I'm really I manage my temper pretty well hold it together and games pretty often I don't react because I'm more emotionally sensitive like crying wise than anything and I hold it together typically until unless I have a really bad practice or until I get home,0.729
847.1,850.5, but overall I have managed my temper pretty well,0.827
861.2,863.6, I think I lost argued with,0.776
865.9,868.9, my boyfriend about something and I think it was along the lines of,0.828
871.2,899.7, just you know wanting to spend time together but needing to find a balance between like seeing each other every single day and like a couple days of the week and kind of managing time between us being together and alone just for the sake of her no having space and not being so dependent on each other and so we kind of argued about that a little bit where we were like we're on the same page but then there's certain times where I just you know would want,0.82
902,905, him to ask to hang out more often than I do,0.873
908.5,918.6, I think about like what she'll be leaving this weekend so we should probably hang out tonight and and that kind of thing but it was it was small but yeah,0.836
933.5,934, um,0.77
937.9,939, well I get,0.798
942.2,946.9, well I guess the way I should have handled like this particular situation is past one,0.857
948.5,974.5, I think when were texting about an issue and all of a sudden it comes up and we're in like a separate place the way I respond with my messages is pretty like you can tell it's not me or you can tell I'm kind of upset and so I've been trying well what I should have done was you know either called and talk to him or just kind of played things off like okay they're fine and and handle the problem like later on the next day when we like saw each other in person next and so when,0.842
976.9,999.1, so that way it's not he can tell I'm upset and we're going to ignore the problem and then both just be upset and and whatever and you know without you know without being petty about it I wish I would have handled that better where I sent a message just explaining once and not repeating myself and not just being blunt and short worded,0.751
1000.7,1001.1, yeah,0.764
1025.9,1026.5, I guess,0.796
1029.3,1048.1, I know I felt like guilty lately about not having gone home to see my family and the opportunities that I've kind of had as while they're short just because I don't know sometimes it's a little overwhelming to go home for just like a day and a half when you hope it's going to be fun and relaxing and you get there and it's,0.848
1049.6,1075.2, a little overwhelming sometimes just because my mom wants to see me and my dad wants to see me and my sisters want to hang out but I only have like a day and a half and then I also have like say water polo you know water polo video to watch or school work I still have to do but then it's like I go home and I can't get any of it done and everybody wants to,0.87
1076.7,1098.7, do something and hang out with me when I have stuff I have to get done and then I'm going to time crunch to finish it and then I just feel bad because I'm not able to focus on them when I'm home and I haven't seen them often and then when I just don't go home when I can then I just feel bad because I know my family misses me and wants to see me and I know water polo is going to have me gone like the whole summer away from them which is kind of sad,0.838
1101,1105.7, but yeah I feel guilty that I don't call home more often and text them more often,0.765
1128,1150.7, I think the hardest decision I've ever had to make was when I was coming to college while like I knew USC was where I wanted to go to play water polo I just knew it which wasn't easy for me to know that it wasn't hard for me to know that that was for sure a big factor but when you consider things like,0.791
1153.4,1165, are you going to be able to play right away are you going to be able to beat out you know the the you know the player that's already here in your spot the cost of school,0.906
1167.6,1197.2, and what your family kind of wants for you that was probably the hardest point in my life as I was also finishing high school and going through my senior year in the fall was pretty overwhelming and I was trying to do all these trips and decide the right place for me and what I knew USC was the right place for me then I had problems like with my family like cost-wise deciding how we were going to make it work if I came here as well as people saying like oh well you know that that other goalies they're like she's pretty good trying to discourage me,0.902
1197.4,1205.9, think make me think that I couldn't you know starter play here ever and that kind of made it a hard decision for me because I didn't know,0.731
1207.3,1219.8, because I didn't feel like I had a hundred percent support when I made it but I'm glad I made it on my own and now I have everybody support or else disproved people in the process,0.889
1229.1,1229.6, hmm,0.693
1239.3,1243.5, well my boyfriend and I broke up for a period of time,0.882
1245.8,1275.4, and I think I kind of regret when he and I started talking again not sharing that with my I guess my roommate / teammates that live with me that he and I were you talking again or that I was hanging out with him and like going to see him and whatnot I regret not telling them because they found out but they knew we texted but they found out and I just really felt bad that I wasn't more open about it but I also just didn't want to bring people bring them more,0.831
1275.6,1303.2, with my problems because I knew they were you know already trying to help me out with the breakup and I know they didn't want me to get hurt but I didn't want to drag them into my problems further when everybody kind of has their own and we have a lot going on with season stuff I just but I do regret not telling them at the same time because I don't want them to think that I don't want to but it also just felt like something I needed to handle on my own and not drag other people into it because I felt like I had been for a while,0.899
1304.3,1306.4, but then it made me feel like I was dishonest with them,0.864
1324.6,1337.2, well the national championships last year our semifinal game is something that kind of haunts me at some point of every day almost,0.898
1340.1,1359.6, and it's something I wish I could take back or reverse and fix and I can't have to think about all the time and regardless of like the wind the year before a possible when this year or next year or possible successful water polo career I,0.889
1361.6,1369.5, I still have to remember even with all those wins all the big losses to and that's when I wish I could erase,0.837
1377.7,1378.2, I served in the military,0.783
1381,1381.7, no I have not,0.877
1395.1,1413.3, I've been feeling really good me and my boyfriend have been back together for a while now and things are good there and water polo has been really really good and my whole family is behind me and I've gotten to see them a little bit I'd like I said I wish I could I've been seeing them more but I've seen them at all these games and,0.892
1415.8,1432, the team's done really well and my bond with the team this year is like our bond is really special so everything's in a good place right now and hopefully we'll finish out the season with a win and I don't know I'm happy I feel good and all aspects I feel balanced and I feel consistent,0.874
1437,1438.1, and I feel confident,0.869
1447.7,1449.7, I think I've felt more,0.8
1451.8,1459.3, confident about myself lately which is made all the difference in water polo and just,0.85
1460.8,1467.5, me in general I've been a lot happier a lot more sure of what I'm doing and why,0.911
1475.4,1485.4, oh it's it's not it's easy it's not that hard I mean we work hard all the day like all day sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night but I have an easy time going back to sleep,0.812
1495.9,1507.9, usually if I get coffee in the next day I'm actually fine for a while but like my moods no different than normal of anything if I'm like really that tired I'm just tired,0.832
1510.3,1511.9, but I usually snap out of it pretty quick,0.893
1521.4,1535.7, yeah I do I've done it a few times before I've seen Sports Sykes I've seen a sport I've seen two different sports Sykes well I've been here at USC which of I don't know it's always been really helpful for me I saw one when I was younger,0.889
1538.6,1560.4, a few times just as family problems kind of went on and yeah now now I see Sports psyche and I find it really helpful just ask somebody to vent to that you know is kind of biased I guess toward everything and then just hears you out and you can vent to and then they can give you ways to address certain things because starting to a lot of the time I don't know,0.793
1578,1581.5, ten years ago if I would have given myself advice,0.796
1584.1,1586.4, I would have actually probably,0.814
1589.1,1618.2, you know told myself to always be as humble as you possibly can and work as hard as you possibly can and be a good person stand up for people as much as you possibly can and I felt like I did those things but just now and in college and what I see of you know certain just certain situations and other people I think it's just really important,0.903
1618.9,1623.3, for kids when they're younger to realize how important it is to,0.807
1624.7,1632.6, kind of openly love people I think that's something that's that's missed and to be more open like there's nothing wrong with,0.87
1634.9,1656.4, you know people knowing you're having a hard day there's nothing wrong with people knowing say you see a therapist or you have issues going on because if we were all a little more open to each other understanding of each other I feel like we don't have nowadays good understanding of each other and so if I could have told myself 10 years ago,0.89
1658.2,1664.3, be there for other people even more than you know then I perhaps was but something I would have said,0.818
1678.8,1706.7, last Friday last Friday we played Stanford at Stanford had a big win I played really well and same with to a like a lot of other teammates and God is just the crowd for SE to be up there like all the parents and fans and everyone was Unreal and to see all the parents smiling outside of the pool and the coaches all,0.841
1706.8,1734.5, be just fun to play especially when you're winning as opposed to losing because that always sucks but just everyone's reaction to a win like that is what makes me most happy to see my teammates ecstatic and the coaches and parents who put so much into it that was you know probably the most recent time I was that happy,0.733
1745.8,1751.6, my dad I think I was really fortunate to have the father that I do,0.87
1754.7,1780.7, he I believe I have like this internal self drive but I think it's because he and my mom have it too and my dad works hard he pays attention to little details he doesn't let anything slide pushes himself all the time and it was really easy for me to pick up on that as I grew up he's there for people regardless of you know what whatever and,0.781
1782.8,1784.8, he's open he speaks well,0.861
1787.6,1795.7, and he's just a good guy and he works hard and has earned the respect of so many for that reason and,0.756
1797.3,1801.7, I don't think I'd be where I am today if I hadn't witnessed that from him,0.884
1811,1816.6, probably odd quirky really loud outgoing Goofy,0.871
1820.6,1826.5, but emotional and passionate and loving and imagine,0.819
1829.3,1830.1, a little tense,0.835
1832.4,1832.8, yeah,0.745
1845.9,1846.6, well I mean,0.762
1854.2,1855.7, I guess I'm most proud of,0.776
1859.7,1888.4, kind of my passion and where I put it and I'm proud that I love taking care of people and being there for people when I can and I wish I was even better at it or had more time to help other people but aside from from you know me you know that I think I'm most proud of how far I've come with water polo in a short time,0.814
