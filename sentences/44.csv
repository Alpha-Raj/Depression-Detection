5.1,7.7,excuse me can I like make it louder,0.792
8.7,9.8, a little louder,0.822
21.5,22.9, yeah thank you,0.827
24.9,25.6, yes,0.792
31.8,32.5, yes,0.897
43.7,49.7, pretty good just had classes at lunch not really did anything,0.89
50.8,52.1, but in general pretty good,0.86
61.6,87.1, I'm from Hong Kong I moved here for college when I was 18 and I'm a senior right now so I've been here for years yeah I pretty like Los Angeles and this country as a whole but not sure with I go back or stay here for job but I'm open to all the opportunities in the future,0.9
99.6,128.4, first of all is the weather because the weather is so chill and you know not much rain unlike Hong Kong Hong Kong is like humid and rainy climate area because it's located in Southeast Asia but here doesn't have much rain and you'll mostly sunny so basically yeah first one is whether and secondly is the food because of the diversity in La I got to,0.828
128.7,144.4, a lot of food Asian or American or Mexican food particularly the tacos they're really good so yeah basically the weather and the food in La the things that I like about in LA,0.807
152.9,181.4, there must be traffic because I drive around to groceries and shopping my leisure time but it seems like it's 24/7 traffic in La so the traffic is really you know really time-consuming and make my costs time cause much greater when I plan to do something for example I want to go to Costco and I have to you know plan ahead,0.863
181.9,194, according to the traffic and I might want to skip the traffic and not stuck in the road for like hours so basically traffic would be to think the first thing that I hate about la,0.863
205.2,234.3, yeah personally I like travel I've traveled been to I've been to service Asia when I was young a couple times and United States and while I'm studying here I've traveled around this country mostly on the west coast San Francisco San Diego you know Las Vegas and I've traveled to the east coast like you know New York Boston a couple times so I like traveling,0.811
235,236.6, I do travel a lot,0.835
244.3,272.3, you know just trying to learn you know new stuff new city and learn about their culture for example I sometimes I go to museums in that City and try to learn things about you know the history but particularly related to that City and secondly would be food because I am sort of foodie so I like to,0.869
273.9,285.7, you know eat food around the world basically so yeah basically learn about the history and food these are the two primary reasons that I travel,0.87
296,322.2, that would be your sanity personally I like to travel in the nature side just somebody I went there with my brother who studied who studied and UC Davis he's now graduated and went back to Hong Kong and then we I traveled to Davis and meet him and then we drove to send your simile it,0.892
322.4,352.1, a pretty good weekend there we just we didn't spend long like my friends my friends like you know hike there spend the entire week there but I didn't I just went there for two days we slept around somebody hotel around you so many I really like the nature you know the waterfall and just basically the environment and the vibe that you're similar gave me really relaxed me and you know prepare me,0.837
352.3,358.9, a for another semester or another exam or just so we can get away it's pretty good,0.79
372.5,399.7, I don't have a particularly memorable experience because all of the experience are memorable I remember I traveled Chicago my girlfriend and during during spring break one of the certain breaks and it was cold and windy and you know it it was my first time to experience that at Mount the amount of wind and we the wind is so strong that we were,0.831
400.4,422.8, you know we're not able to open our eyes even though we were just walking like two blocks from our hotel to get food that was like really memorable I guess but other than that I really liked every trip that I travel so yeah maybe the Chicago when would be the most memorable trip,0.836
430.5,459.1, I'm a business major and favorite subject would be financed or Finance related subjects for instance I'm taking mergers and acquisition right now and derivatives although the subject itself is really hard but I really enjoy studying and I don't know I just like you know doing Finance related subjects like you know mathematical or concept,0.907
461,462, yeah I just like it,0.741
470.5,497.2, I am a student and what do I do I'm a full-time student here I'm a senior I basically you know go to class study meet some friends hang out a bit and yeah I didn't do many I didn't do much jobs I didn't do pot I used to do part-time part-time job but not right now I'm still full time student so,0.86
498.4,500, yeah basically that's it,0.837
515.4,542.1, it would be my dream job would be working for soccer club because I really like playing soccer in Europe we say football or you know out of outside of United States we say football so I would like to work in a football club and you know just train with football players or even you know plans their strategy their game tactics,0.872
542.6,572.3, or just be a part of that club because I really like the like the sport itself so that would be my dream job but obviously those jobs needs like particular certifications in like sports related Business Degree I guess so yeah other than Finance if I can choose I would definitely go for sports management or commercial Sports those kind of things,0.913
572.4,575, it's because those are my interest,0.828
584.9,613.4, I would say myself more shy initially because I'm not sure how to you know when I first meet a person or new friend I'm like kind of like more shy type because I still need time to get used to or get along with that person but when I am close friend or a really good friend or classmate with that person then I would be more you know more express myself,0.889
614.9,628.1, and to talk a little bit more about our mutual interest and stuff but after all and overall I would say myself I would recognize myself as more shy person,0.779
636,662.9, oh because I don't feel that comfortable it just talking to like random people or express myself too much or talk you know have a really deep conversation with strangers or people that I just met so I need to get used to you know get some time knowing or get used to or you don't understand more about that person before I really express myself,0.861
664.8,666.9, is fuel more comfortable doing that way,0.765
674.8,703.3, my relationship my family is I would say is really good particularly after college when I was in high school you know pressurized study you know those kind of exams made me not to communicate much with my parents but after that as I as I am studying abroad I do miss them quite a bit and started to you know FaceTime or Skype or,0.912
703.7,717.3, there's just a lot of ways to communicate more and you know I feel like I know more about my parents and my parents know more about me so I would say definitely it's a very good relationship with my parents,0.832
727.9,757.5, I iive to that message to release my pressure what I was you know during midterm week or before midterm week or you know finals the first of all is running I don't know why but after I run I really have a good feeling or feel motivated or just you know forget about all those things that upset me or pressurized me so running would be definitely the first,0.875
759.8,787.4, first method to relax myself secondly would be playing piano since I love playing music and particularly piano makes me relaxed as I was playing and normally after I play piano I get more relaxed and more comfortable feeling and motivated to do the job or tasks in the,0.907
787.6,788, future,0.803
797,825.1, first of all I would make a deep breath when I get angry I would just make DeGraff to try to control my immediate temper and secondly I would try to talk my way or you know let my brain process what is happening or you know what had happened in a logical,0.903
825.3,845.3, sense and try to calm myself by you know explaining or telling myself what happened or telling myself I shouldn't do that I shouldn't you know get angry that easily and that way I can control my temper,0.905
857.6,884.5, last time it should it would be my argument my girlfriend we argued you know those arguments that couple normal couple has we argued I think we argued about food or something just I don't really remember it's I remember that moment that we were both hungry like really hungry after like a long trip or something,0.909
885.1,913.6, and then we're unable to find food because you know time was late and just not much good restaurants opened and kind of argue I couldn't control my temper because I was angry too and I don't see a solution or a way out at that moment so yeah we argued about food but after that we found a good restaurant we settled everything we're good so yeah,0.909
930.6,959.8, I would say for example the food argument I'm would plan it more efficiently for example as I plan a road trip or a trip I should estimate the time and you know the estimated arrival time and search about the restaurants around that City or just plan ahead at that time I wasn't sure or didn't plan that much ahead of time that's why it makes,0.709
960.3,973.7, both of us really frustrated yeah so it would it would be plan ahead and more efficiently to get to you know to get going to get the stuff going,0.897
992.1,1018.9, guilty I would say not spending too much time with my family because I'm studying abroad I always feel this guilty as that I couldn't be with my family and particularly my grandparents because I know that my grandparents do miss me a lot that's why every holiday like winter or summer I would definitely go back and just spend time with my family and sometimes,0.913
1019,1019.9, my friends,0.802
1020.9,1037.5, because I just feel this I just have this guilty to trying to spend more time with them because I am not available to spend time with them doing a usual time doing the usual semester time so yeah,0.898
1054.9,1056.8, the hardest decision would be,0.837
1059.9,1088.9, during my sophomore year my grandparents my grandpa passed away and I wasn't sure should I go like I want to go back but since there's a midterm coming up and it's like 30 or 40 percent I've even forgot the map for go with subject but yeah but on the syllabus it says if you miss midterm then your grades would be like a great portion would be allocated to the final that,0.827
1089.1,1118.9, a 30% on the midterm and 30% on the final then if I missed the midterm final would be 60% then I'm like okay should I go back to my Grandpa's funeral or judges student midterm and you know ease the pressure on the finals that that was the hardest decision I would say within it to my family but at last I chose to go back and you know tend to fit a roll and just spend time,0.861
1119,1133.7, my grandma grandmother so at last I think I did well I think I did like okay not particularly well did ya okay on that finals but,0.789
1135.3,1137.7, it was a tough decision after all,0.913
1153,1180.3, yeah of course I regret not exploring too much in my university life by exploring I mean traveling I would regret that I haven't traveled much before going to work because I know that if I go to work I wouldn't have much time or a limited time too,0.9
1180.8,1209.7, and with my girlfriend or my friends or even myself because you know vacation are very limited and I don't have much free time while I work so I will regret about not exploring the world as much as I could for instant traveling to like let's say Russia or Eastern Europe I would definitely love to travel there,0.903
1210.9,1240.3, you know like spending like two weeks or three weeks there to just know the city or know the know the country know the culture there but since I'm a senior so I don't have much time left to do that but hopefully in the future I can I can you know get some time to finish my dream you know to of traveling and that could be that would that would be the best option,0.772
1250.7,1279.9, definitely the travel like I mean when I was young I always traveled my parents and my elder brother but I you know I didn't really have much memory about that because I was like very young I was like four years old and I don't really have memories I remember when mom always talked about this you know during the year 2000 we were in Florida Disney you know counting down,0.751
1280.7,1309.1, having fun but I have totally no clue what's happened when I when I saw the pictures or sort of photos I still don't I mean I recognize myself but I still don't have the memory when I was young not only the United States my mom always my mom also told me that we have traveled to like Thailand Singapore Japan,0.913
1310,1323.9, but I seriously don't have memory when I was very young the first memory that I have would be I think Elementary School yeah Elementary School when I traveled to,0.871
1325.1,1343.3, yeah Sophie say one of the southeast Asia countries so if I can remember those memories that it would be nice that you know I can talk about it with my family not but not like you know only my mom talk about it towards me but not you know while I don't recall anything,0.787
1358.9,1388.5, no I haven't served in the military and since Hong Kong is only a city-state we don't have our own military so and we are not you know it's not compulsory to conserve and Military is all is always fallen Terry so I didn't serve in the military but I would love to try on it like a training camp will like to do Hui training camp because some of my friends from Korea they you know they're mandatory they have met,0.853
1388.7,1408.3, hurry military service and I just feel like there's so much benefits for example just like training up your body regulate your time being more disciplined with your life I just feel like it's pretty cool to have trained in the military but not like you know Battlefield or something,0.896
1418.8,1421.8, I didn't join the military I did not join the military,0.821
1431.7,1437.4, I did not join the military I am interested in joining a training camp but,0.855
1439.1,1448.6, oh yeah if this opportunity come I might join but now or in the past I did not join the military,0.87
1456.4,1486.1, yeah I'm pretty happy because I don't have to you know eat cafeteria food or you know bunch of guys training running I would say it's pretty nice not joining the military you know joining military have both benefits and disadvantages but I am glad that I didn't like my country doesn't have this compulsory service so I'm pretty sure pretty good with that,0.855
1500.8,1509.4, no I'd ever see combat because I didn't join the military so yeah I didn't,0.913
1523.7,1548.8, I did not join the military so I guess I'm always in the civilian slave it was pretty easy it was good to be here I've heard stuff about military stuff from you know documentaries and stuff but as since I'm always here in civilians life I'm pretty good with that,0.831
1559.9,1576.7, I once again I did not join the military I did not join the military so long as usual I guess I'm a full-time student yeah basically I did not join the military don't get confused,0.912
1589.1,1604.8, I didn't know I join the military so it hasn't changed me much it did not change me at all because I am not serving I did not serve I have not been served so that that's my answer,0.704
1618.8,1621.8, I Feel Good Just finish exam,0.853
1623.3,1628.5, nothing much to do just chilling waiting for finals that's it,0.892
1638.7,1643.9, not really lately but in terms of my university life I think,0.888
1644.9,1674.5, I mean I made up my mind I get my mind's clear of what I want to do in the future or what I'm interested at least now I know that I want to do finance and was like I like watching sports unlike some of my friends really they even the graduated they really don't know what they're doing or they want to do in the future and that would be an advantage for me and I'm happy about you know knowing myself,0.84
1674.7,1680.2, more in these 4 years before I go to the work,0.769
1689.1,1714.6, it's pretty easy but not really because what particularly in finals three core in midterm week it's you know usual sleepness sleepless nights I couldn't really get much rest but now since all my midterms are over I'm pretty confident that I can have a good night's sleep,0.846
1723.1,1751.4, I don't sleep well I mean I feel tired you know just looking at the ceiling not doing anything but I try to sleep I am tired and I try to sleep but I couldn't do that that bothers me but this happened occasionally when I was stressed but after that as the pressure he stabbed it I'm pretty sure I can get back to a good sleep,0.886
1763.2,1765.6, no you can go ahead I'm done,0.831
1775.9,1804.5, yeah to somebody yeah to those who need somebody to talk with or I guess you mean therapy it's like counseling like person-to-person counseling I think it's pretty good particularly when a person is stress or if a problem that they couldn't figure out always therapy allows more like a person to hear you your opinion or your thoughts that would,0.913
1805,1816.7, make that person or the problem is or pretentiously go away so I think therapy is useful for somebody,0.848
1832.8,1858.3, don't think too much I would say there's 10 years ago you know I only study I think it's in middle school or even early I think or Elementary School yeah I would advise myself not to think that much if you have an idea or have something to do then just do it and don't,0.913
1858.4,1870.7, overthink it you know I have some concern about you know study concerned about my parents are concerned about you know this and that I would suggest myself to just have a straight line and just go for it,0.856
1888.7,1917, last time I felt really happy or I think it's winter break because I went to New York and my girlfriend and Ice met a couple of my high school friends that we're studying New York that trip was really happy because first of all I control the person that I want to travel with and second of all I get to I got to MIT meet all my old friends,0.708
1918.1,1927.9, or friends I haven't met for like three or four years I'm pretty happy and I'm actually really happy after that trip because,0.811
1929.3,1956.1, I feel that this is you know this is like the last opportunity not really the last one but like almost the last opportunity before I graduated before I decide what do I want to do in the future I got to meet all these old friends people and we chat about old times when I was in high school when we were in high school and you know fun moments so pretty comfortable and really happy,0.886
1969.8,1996.6, I would say a friend called actually he's my high school friend he's got Ambrose he's studying in a college in San Francisco we've been friends with not actually talk too much in high school but since we came to United States together in the same California you know and we met more often and you know as we get older much more mature we share,0.862
1997,1998.2, mines and,0.713
2000.2,2029, you know have some deep tall or drinking or you know just Gathering generally and he kind of inspired me a lot in to what I want to do and according to him I inspired him a lot too but I didn't really do much I just talked to him like a lot and just share my experience and he showed his experience and we become like best friends right now yeah he's one of my best friends in college I would say,0.84
2029.2,2030.2, and in high school,0.788
2039.9,2067.4, we always do weird stuff together like really outgoing stuff or stuff that I won't do myself it's pretty funny to you know just to talk about it or just think back what we done but he described me as like a good friend or a good brother or sort of like a bromance those kind of stuff so yeah we were,0.909
2068.2,2084.1, clothes and since he's all his also in business finance and we always talk about you know school work studies basically a lot of things he would grab I think he regard me as a really good friend,0.721
2100.5,2127, I really enjoyed recently that must be the road trip that I've been with my girlfriend you know we've been to Las Vegas and drove to San Francisco you know just Yosemite Pastor recently it's pretty nice road trip because we can talk a lot and you know share our feelings and have a great conversation you know talk about literally everything,0.913
2127.1,2146, thing like you know topics around around the world like you know the United States or even Europe or even in Asia we have a lot of topics in common and we can just share our feelings and that was a that was a great trip and a good experience recently,0.912
2154.1,2156, no I'm done I'm done thank you,0.86
