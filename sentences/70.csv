93.2,109.4, I don't like the traffic in the driving because I have always enjoyed driving but I feel like I can't really do it here in the city and I don't like I guess just like the I mean it's kind of dangerous where we live so that's a little unsettling as well,0.902
120.8,133.5, yeah I mean I think kind of more so in the past when my family lived abroad in Brazil we travelled a lot but not as much recently but I have been to like a lot of interesting places so it's nice,0.814
145.1,172, just I guess experiencing a new culture and just kind of seeing how people interact with each other and the way that they live their life in different countries because just kind of their General mannerisms and just the kind of I don't know it just so different from even if you travel in the u.s. things are so different like and whether you're like in the midwest or the East Coast the west coast and like being going to Europe and South America everyone interacts with differently with each other and it's just like really interesting to see that,0.89
183.9,210.3, well a couple years ago for my brother's graduation from high school my grandparents took me and him to a trip in Europe and that was really interesting because we got to I mean it was more centered towards what my grandmother wanted to do because she's very religious so I went to a lot of different churches but it was really interesting and a good experience I feel like for me and my brother to spend some quality time with my grandparents,0.823
222,248.8, a slightly vague question I feel like I could say a lot of things I guess just I feel like a lot of my memorable Expendable experiences come from like maybe living in Brazil and just moving around a lot just because like going through such a drastic change kind of sticks out in your memory a lot so a lot of the things that I got to see there we're so different and then also just like big life events I guess like graduation,0.807
249,252.1, and prom and all those things,0.861
263.1,282.7, I took that science courses in high school so I took like two years of biology and two years of chemistry I really liked biology just because I think it's super interesting understanding how things work and it was just something that I kind of my brain worked well with and I understood it and that was always really interesting so probably biology,0.785
290.8,306.3, I'm a cognitive science major I'm thinking about maybe double majoring or adding a minor but I am taking psychology human biology stats and a g sin and all my courses are super interesting and I'm really enjoying like the content that we're learning about,0.889
320.8,346.9, I'm very undecided about what I want to do after college if I could do something just completely if I just had any choice maybe something with like maybe running a non-profit or being the CEO of a non-profit or just something that I could maybe like travel and help people and do something along the lines of that but just like any work that you're going into a non-profit like doesn't necessarily,0.872
348.3,365.4, I mean I don't know you don't really know if you're gonna like be able to support yourself financially so I think my parents are more reluctant about that whole idea but so if not that maybe just something with psychology and just understanding people like mental health wise and trying to like help them in that way or just something like that I guess,0.844
375,397.1, I'm probably more shy I like as a kid I was always pretty shy moving around like tried like forced me a little bit to kind of be less shy but I'm I think I'm more introverted I'm not the type of person that like goes up and starts conversations with people but I'm like very willing to engage in conversations and like I love interacting with the people that I'm close with I'm just like not a very outgoing person,0.778
405.8,433.7, I'm assuming you're asking my amore shy I think that just I don't know I was always as a kid this way so maybe like partially genetic factors may be like partially just like the environment that I was raised in as a kid I don't know maybe just like also just like a little bit of like insecurities like I feel like I don't always necessarily think people would want to engage in a conversation so I'm more reluctant to go up and start one I just don't feel like I don't want to bother them and just kind of I don't want to be annoying,0.909
434.2,435.3, and I'm just I don't know,0.848
450.8,478.5, well I have very nice parents and I don't know and so I guess my brother has a more strained relationship with my dad and I have a little bit of a strained relationship with my mom but nothing too severe I just I don't know I feel like I get along better with my dad and my mom is like a very nice person but she's was just not always the most kind of like considerate and thoughtful and I feel like I could always tell that she favored my brother a little bit,0.842
479.7,503.2, but they're like very supportive and nice and I'm like thankful for them my brother has a really bad temper so we kind of have that like big issues but we've gone into some arguments because he just like has a really bad temper but he's like seeking help now for it so yeah I mean overall not that bad but just little things I guess,0.887
512.7,531.7, I enjoy spending time with my close friends mostly I feel like that relieves a lot of stress just when we were laughing and having a good time I also like to watch TV sometimes read if I can find a book that I'm actually interested in listen to music sometimes like exercise or dance or something,0.772
533.9,534.3, yeah,0.833
540.7,570.7, I don't really I think that I don't really have a huge I don't really get angry that often but sometimes I get sad so I don't know know a few other thing that's not really considered a temper but like sometimes I'm more like neurotic in the sense where my emotions can be a little extreme and harder to control I get very anxious but I don't really get super angry I'm never like at the point where I'm screaming at someone or anything like it Angry I'm more get quiet and I'm just kind of thinking about it,0.891
570.8,576.3, my head so I wouldn't really say I have like a bad temper but I do like it very sad sometimes,0.802
590.4,617.1, well I don't know if I would consider it an argument but it was more just like a tense conversation I'm talking to him so it's like having a relationship I guess with my boyfriend from high school even though we're not officially dating anymore and last night we were just talking about how we need to kind of communicate better and stuff and it was really an argument like there's no scolding or yelling and we were both being,0.912
617.2,622.1, understanding but it was more like a tense conversation it wasn't necessarily an enjoyable one,0.808
640,642.2, I was there's nothing else that I was going to say,0.867
660.9,686.8, I guess in high school I had these two really close girlfriends I mean we're still friends now we're just not as close as we used to be and I feel like I was kind of immature sometimes in the way that we handle our disagreements I mean I'm not they were also what kind of immature but I feel like I could have maybe just I feel like I just don't I feel like I was a little dramatic and I wish it would have kind of been more realistic and more,0.877
687.2,698, with the way that I handled things and also maybe like with my mom I guess I could try to like I don't know there's some times where I wish I would have been more patient,0.85
722.8,752.4, I guess maybe if I were to like say something bad okay so I have I have this one friend and she's been kind of distant lately and so like I talked about that and like our relationship heard of my other friends and I didn't say anything too bad but I feel like I maybe was a little harsh and I did feel a little bit bad about like what I said not that it really didn't like lead anything bad but I feel like I probably like was a little hard,0.823
752.6,753, her,0.705
768.5,773.3, I should think about that one for a little I don't really know the hardest decision I've had to make,0.833
774.9,802.6, um I'm a very indecisive person so I feel like every decision is one that I kind of put a lot of thought into and even like I don't know it's hard for me to come to a decision and even then like I think I really go to a lot of different people for their opinion so like my parents are my friends I'll go to them for their input so I can't I can't think of one decision that like I really struggled with personally because I,0.832
804.1,833.9, like struggle with every simple decision that I make and I always get people's input so I feel kind of like Justified I guess when I make that decision I don't think I've ever done anything extremely drastic I guess maybe like picking which college I wanted to go to was a big decision but in turn but all I feel like all of the major things that happened in my life were decisions made by other people like moving around or relationship stuff was more other people,0.876
834.1,840.7, decisions because I'm just not one that like makes drastic changes on my own so I don't know,0.846
864.9,866.9, I don't I'm trying to think,0.857
867.8,897.5, well this is a very small thing I guess but when I was in third grade I remember I had two friends and they originally didn't like each other and then they would always argue with like who I would play with during recess because it was in third grade and then eventually they became friends with each other which I guess was a good thing because on all three of us were friends but this one time I don't know why I always felt like such a bad person I do this but we were sitting at,0.899
897.7,927.5, a cafeteria lunch table and they were like whispering to each other in front of me and like I had like lean back so I could like whisper a secret to each other and I guess for some reason that made my third grade self very upset because they would always like put me in at they always like we're kind of like it seems like I don't know they were like arguing for me to be friends with one and not the other and then all of a sudden they were best friends and they were leaving me out and I like push their heads together and I'm got like lunch detention and I know that I was young but I feel like,0.795
927.6,935.7, like that was so I don't even know why I did that it was just stupid now that it's like haunts me at night but I feel bad about myself for that,0.825
952.3,978.1, well it's kind of very personal I guess I don't know it's not a okay well when I was like 7 I was molested by my babysitter so I guess I can't wish I could erase that but it's not like it wasn't like I mean it was obviously bad but it wasn't like the worst thing in the world like I'm sure that I'm like okay I guess but if I were to just like a race something I probably,0.761
978.2,981, pick that just because it's obviously a terrible thing,0.801
992.5,992.9, now,0.793
1003.1,1029.1, good I feel like coming back from spring break I've been in a little bit more of a funk I guess I may have been fine but just maybe a little bit more anxious than before but like overall I guess I'm pretty content with like where my life is I just I just like I've just been feeling okay very medium I guess I don't know,0.797
1039.4,1041.5, this past week I've been just a little,0.876
1042.8,1064, like keeping to myself more like just like not going out and seeing my friends as often as I usually do but I don't really think it's anything that that out of ordinary I think I've just been a little bit tired and just uninterested this past week but nothing too extreme,0.869
1069.4,1070.1, how easy is it,0.653
1075,1086.4, I can fall I didn't fall asleep pretty easily I'm bad at going to bed at a reasonable time and I'm bad at waking up in the morning but it's not hard for me to sleep I could sleep all day,0.822
1097.8,1115.1, I can just harder when I do when I don't sleep well it's harder for me to control my emotions so I'll just be like a little bit more irritable or maybe I'll like cry more easily not the like I would cry every single time but it would just be harder for me to kind of restrict myself from getting upset or your table,0.815
1131,1150.6, I've never done it I feel like it depends on the person because I have friends that really hated it when they did it and I other people that speak highly of it so I guess it just depends on like the therapist and the person themselves I think it can be useful but just not only always,0.853
1171.4,1200.4, I feel like 10 years ago I would so I would be 8 I guess I would say to try to see things from other people's perspective and I guess not take everything so personally and also try not to put too much pressure on certain situations or myself because a lot of things don't really matter in the long run and I feel like I really stressed myself out,0.805
1200.5,1202.4, a lot when I probably didn't have to,0.813
1222.8,1244.1, I don't know I mean I can't think of something extreme but I guess just when I hang out with my friends I'm in a like happy mood and laughing and having a good time but I can't think of like one super memorable time I was really happy because I yeah I don't know I think everything's more of just like a moderate,0.839
1245.3,1245.8, I don't know,0.728
1256.7,1286, Reese more recently like my friends here like there's this one friend that I just met a few months ago when I first came to USA because I'm a freshman and she just a very positive easygoing happy person and I feel like she kind of motivates me to not take things so seriously and just kind of brush things off instead of like over worrying and over stressing and I think that's kind of been a positive influence because I kind of,0.883
1286.1,1292.1, to like let things go a little bit more and not put so much pressure on like an exam or what not,0.839
1303.4,1329.6, well when I've talked to her she is very compliment Tori so she like says that I'm very caring and empathetic and like loyal but I mean I'm trying to think of its um I guess yeah I should probably say that I'm more I'm very yeah like more sensitive and empathetic and caring but like I'm not as easygoing as she is,0.734
1332.7,1333.2, yeah,0.755
1347.2,1347.9, I,0.627
1352.5,1365.7, I really enjoyed I hung out with some friends on Wednesday with some people in my sorority that I'm not super close with and it was fun to kind of get to know them more and just spend some time with them,0.876
1378,1404.1, I'm probably proud of that's a two things one I feel like I've like been very supportive friend and a lot of people like have kind of like made me feel good about the effect that I've had on their lives I mean I don't know if they're saying that but I feel like I've kind of like help people through some bad things which I'm makes me feel good that I was able to kind of be there for a lot of people and I'm also proud of just like,0.753
1405.2,1410.9, academic achievements and just getting into a good school and like I'm happy with kind of like where I am in my life,0.897
