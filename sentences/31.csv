387.1,405.8, I wish I got a higher ACT score I needed one more point in order to have gone and played at Harvard but I don't know if necessarily Harvard or USC water polo would have been a better option because Harvard water polo is not nearly the caliber that USC is but it would be just a different experience I wouldn't be used to,0.864

543.4,551.6, yeah I just did I just did enjoy like with my family and friends so I have like a close bond with communicating with more than outside sources,0.784
